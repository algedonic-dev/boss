# Round-trip-write check.
#
# For each service that handles writes, POST a sentinel row, query
# Postgres directly to confirm the row landed, then DELETE the row.
# Catches the silent in-memory-fallback class of bug: the service
# returns 200 with a payload (because it wrote to a process-local
# map), but Postgres never sees the row.
#
# Why this exists: 2026-04-28 boss-docs-api was running in-memory
# only because it was built without `--features postgres`. POSTs
# returned 200; the design_pending_decisions table stayed empty. (That
# table, that POST and the whole boss-docs service are gone since
# 2026-09-10 — the crate that named this bug class no longer exists,
# but the class does; see below.)
# Option (1) of the fix (boss_core::startup::require_postgres_or_explicit_inmemory)
# stops the next regression at *boot*. This script is the
# defense-in-depth check that catches the same class of bug at
# *runtime* — useful in cron and after deploys.
#
# Usage:
#   ./infra/check-service-write-roundtrip.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all round-trips succeeded
#   1 — at least one check failed (a write returned 200 but Postgres
#       has no row, a list disagreed with its table, or the call
#       itself failed)

# boss-docs-api was the original subject of this whole script (the

# only write endpoint; part 2, the same day, took the service, its
# three tables and the parser behind them (backlog f5da586c) — the
# packet is the doc, so there is no corpus to keep consistent with
# anything. The two read-consistency checks below carry the signal it
# used to: a list endpoint that disagrees with its table is an
# in-memory fallback, and no fallback can fake agreement.
# `boss-classes-api` requires ?subject_kind=… — pick `employee`, the
# largest classes namespace today.
