# Boss — Caddy front door setup
#
# Installs Caddy, drops in the Caddyfile, wires up the hostname, and starts
# the service. Caddy handles Let's Encrypt issuance + renewal automatically
# as long as DNS resolves and ports 80/443 are reachable.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo BOSS_HOSTNAME=example.com ./setup.sh [--force]
#
# Environment:
#   BOSS_HOSTNAME — public hostname that resolves to this VM (required)
#
# Flags:
#   --force — install over an /etc/caddy/Caddyfile that differs from this
#             quickstart's, backing the old one up first. Without it the
#             script refuses: that path also carries real front doors
#             (boss-gcp serves playground.algedonic.dev + id.algedonic.dev
#             from it, tracked at infra/gcp/caddy/Caddyfile), and a
#             quickstart run must not silently replace one.
