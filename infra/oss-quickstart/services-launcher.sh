# background, captures their PIDs, and waits. SIGTERM forwards to
# every child; if any child exits, the launcher exits too so
# Docker's restart policy can kick in.
#
# This isn't a real init system (no log rotation, no restart-on-
# crash, no dependency ordering beyond start-everything-in-parallel).
# It's the simplest thing that lets `docker compose up boss-services`
# bring the full stack up. Production deploys use systemd directly;
# tenants who outgrow the docker quickstart have the runbook for
# that path.
