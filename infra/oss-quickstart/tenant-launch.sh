# tenant-launch.sh — publish the tenant, then start the sim; DEGRADE,
# never brick. Sourced by services-launcher.sh; exercised by
# infra/lint/a-failed-prepare-degrades-the-pod.sh under stubs.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-02 a Workflow row landed whose `task`
# step required a field the prepare walker did not send. The brewery
# prepare answered 400 three times, seed-brewery-tenant.sh exited 1
# (correctly — it refuses to stamp a reset baseline over a failed
# prepare, which is what saved the tenant model), and the launcher's
# `set -e` turned that exit into ITS exit. The container died, Kubernetes
# restarted it, and it died again: the jobs API was down for 65 minutes
# over a seed that was one field short — while every API had been up
# and serving on localhost throughout the walk, and the gateway, which
# starts AFTER the sim in the launch order, never started at all
# (packets 88a07cc4, 089a99bc).
#
# THE CONTRACT. A failed tenant prepare is a DEGRADED pod, not a dead
# one: every API stays up and the gateway starts, the sim stays down
# (it would post jobs the registry cannot admit), the reset baseline
# stays untouched (the seed script's own guard, unchanged), and prepare
# retries on a cadence until it succeeds — at which point the sim
# starts, late, exactly as it would have. The abort-before-baseline
# behaviour is the thing being preserved here, not worked around.
#
# HOW THE RETRY STAYS A CHILD THAT NEVER "EXITS". The launcher's
# `wait -n` ends the pod when ANY child leaves. The retry loop runs as
# a background subshell whose PID joins the launcher's list, and on
# success it EXECS the sim in place — the same PID becomes the sim, so
# the launcher sees one long-lived child, never a departure.
#
# LOUD. Every attempt and the degraded state itself print a line that
# starts with `DEGRADED:`, so the pod log can be grepped for the word
# by a reader that never saw the first failure.
#
# The three hooks below are functions so the self-test can replace
# them; the launcher uses the defaults.

# Where the seed scripts live in the image; overridable so the shell
# test (crates/core/boss-testing/tests/the_launcher_publishes_a_tenant_
# by_its_id.rs) can point publish_tenant at stubs.

# The platform operator baseline, then the tenant publish, then — for

#
# ONE DOOR FOR EVERY TENANT (tenant-publish-for-every-tenant; backlog
# b644d727, 2026-09-17). Until ee7b62bb (2026-09-16) seed-brewery-
# tenant.sh ran unconditionally, so a deployment pointed at a tenant
# with no engine — Algedonic, LLC — would still have seeded the
# brewery; that car chose the script by `[meta] tenant_id`, and the
# brewery kept its engine's prepare as its ONLY publish. Measured
# 2026-09-17: that prepare POSTs classes.json but never
# seeds/locations.toml nor seeds/chart_of_accounts.toml — the
# playground inherited its sites and its chart from the migrations —
# and nothing published the brewery's own seeds/rules.toml at all, so
# an instance whose product files no longer carry those reactors ran
# the brewery with none. Now `boss tenant publish <dir>`
# (seed-tenant.sh) runs for every tenant, brewery included — after
# the operator baseline, see below — and the engine script runs LAST
# for the sim data (accounts, vendors, products, parts, opening
# balances), the operator hires and the reset-baseline stamp. Both
# are idempotent against each other, in
# this order: the engine's own classes post is insert-if-absent
# (inserted 0), its calendars batch replaces the same rows by code,
# its company mint upserts, its policy publish GETs first, its people
# posts answer 409 on the roster the door just landed, and its
# workflow walk skips every kind an authoring Job already published —
# which also stamps the brewery's Workflows with owning_team
# `brewery` (the contract's rule: the manifest's tenant_id), where the
# engine wrote `brewery-bootstrap`. The reverse order is NOT safe once
# a fresh instance evicts the migrations' example rows (backlog
# 718ac982): the engine's people posts count a 409 as "already there",
# so a roster whose `location` no door had seeded would be skipped in
# silence.
#
# THE BASELINE GOES FIRST, handed the tenant dir (backlog 1ee28274,
# 2026-09-18). Two constraints pull on this order, and the file the
# publish is about to send satisfies both:
#
#   Q7 — the baseline's injected emp-bootstrap-admin is the ONLY
#   platform-admin on an example instance, and owner resolution needs
#   a human platform-admin before ANY platform Job can open. With the
#   baseline second (b644d727, 2026-09-17) the fresh playground's
#   publish 400ed at seeds/workflows.toml — "no responsible human
#   resolvable for owner automation:bootstrap (owner_role
#   platform-admin)" — and the pod ran DEGRADED, sim down, retrying
#   every 300 s: 0 tenant rules, 0 workflow-design packets (read
#   through pod-logs, 2026-09-18 04:42Z).
#
#   0d2d7daa (2026-09-16) — a real company's roster declares its
#   founder with exactly the BOSS_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL address, and a
#   baseline that injects first gives the fresh instance the bootstrap
#   row and then refuses the founder on the LOWER(email) unique index.
#   That is why the baseline was moved second in the first place.
#
# The resolution: boss-operator-baseline-seed reads the tenant's
# DECLARED roster from the seed file — BOSS_TENANT_DIR/seeds/
# employees.json, not the API, which is empty until the publish — and
# skips the bootstrap-admin injection when that file declares the
# email ("declared by the tenant's roster; the publish lands it"),
# while still seeding the other operator hires. A roster that does not
# declare it (the brewery's) gets the injection as before, and the
# publish then finds its platform-admin. The brewery's engine expects
# the bootstrap admin to exist, so it runs last. Each step returns at
# once on failure — the DEGRADED loop retries this function whole — so
# the publish never runs against an instance that cannot open a
# platform Job, and the engine never seeds against a half-published
# tenant.
#
# THE ESTATE GOES BEFORE ALL OF IT (backlog ee368d0c, 2026-09-18). The
# machines this instance runs on are the INSTANCE's declaration —
# infra/estate/estate.toml, published by seed-estate.sh through the
# estate door, insert-if-absent — not a tenant's and not a
# migration's: until that car the estate reached a database only as a
# schema migration, so every fresh database booted declaring this
# LAN's seven machines. It needs no platform-admin (no packet opens)
# and nothing after it needs to wait, but the converges that read a
# host's roles off /api/estate/nodes and the observer that compares
# declared against observed want it before anything else, so it runs
# first; its failure is the verdict like the others'.
#
# ONCE PER DATABASE (backlog 6a8d4972, design e187198f car 2,
# 2026-09-18). Until this car the tenant publish ran at EVERY services
# start with no guard, so a converge's ConfigMap rebuild implied a
# publish and — until car 1 made every door insert-if-absent — four
# doors overwrote a live row on each boot. Now the publish reads the
# stamp a successful `boss tenant publish` leaves in the database
# (`boss tenant published`, tenant_publishes) and runs only while it
# is absent — a fresh instance: the OSS quickstart, the playground, a
# switched database — or when BOSS_TENANT_TAKE names registries, car
# 1's `--take` for one boot. A running instance's launcher prints ONE
# line and moves on. The estate, the baseline and the engine are not
# the tenant publish and keep running: each is idempotent, the engine
# owns the sim's reset baseline, and the baseline's operator hires are
# the platform's, not the tenant's. The verb run by an operator reads
# no stamp — `boss tenant publish <dir>` after the stamp still inserts
# absent rows (car 1's behaviour), which is how a row authored in the
# repo reaches a running instance; the stamp gates only THIS automatic
# publish.
