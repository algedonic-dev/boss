# Init container — runs on EVERY start, converges the schema, then exits 0.
#
# init runs PRE-API: the boss-services container (which brings the API
# stack up) starts only after this exits. So init does only what can be
# done without the services:
#   1. Wait for Postgres.
#   2. Converge the per-module schema — on every start, whatever the
#      database already holds.
#   3. First start only: provision the bootstrap-admin's local-auth
#      credential (a file write) and prime the formula clock.
#
# Everything that goes through the public API — the operator-baseline +
# bootstrap-admin EMPLOYEE, the brewery tenant (classes, Workflows, policy,
# accounts/vendors/data), and the sim that builds the demo live — is run by
# boss-services (services-launcher.sh) once the API is up. That's why
# operator/employee seeding can't live here: boss-operator-baseline-seed
# POSTs /api/people, which isn't listening during init.
#
# Why step 2 is unconditional
# ---------------------------
# This script used to ask "is the schema present?" and exit 0 if it was —
# so it initialized an EMPTY database and nothing else in the deploy path
# ever applied a NEW migration to an existing one. On 2026-08-13 that let
# four migrations (112, 113, 114, 116) accumulate unapplied on the cluster
# while the image, the code and the config all rolled forward: the station
# registry shipped, the deploy reported success, and `GET /api/stations`
# answered 500 `relation "stations" does not exist`. Schema is part of the
# tree and converges from the tree like the rest of it.
#
# Converging is safe to repeat: migrate.sh is idempotent by ledger — it
# applies only manifest entries not yet recorded in schema_migrations, each
# in one transaction with its bookkeeping row. A converge against an
# up-to-date database applies nothing and says so.
#
# A migration failure FAILS this container, and so the pod: a half-migrated
# database that keeps serving is worse than a visible failure.
#
# The first-start-only steps stay first-start-only on purpose. Re-running
# `boss-auth set` would reset an operator's rotated password to the default
# on every restart, and re-priming sim_clock would drag a running
# playground's epoch backwards. Clean restart is `docker compose down -v`
# then `up`.

# ticks forward at 1000x instead of sitting frozen at wall-time. The post-API
