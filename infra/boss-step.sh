# boss-step — close a step on the open Job of a given Workflow.

#   ./infra/boss-step.sh regenerate-deployment build source_ref=abc1234
#
# The point: work a machine did should be recorded by the machine that
# did it. A regen's `build` step closing because the build script
# finished is a fact; the same step closing because someone typed
# afterwards is a claim. The reason to model an operation as a Job is
# that its state stays true without anyone maintaining it.
#
# ## Behaviour
#
# Finds the single OPEN Job of `<workflow>`, finds the step by its
# spec slug (`steps.spec_slug`, the stable machine-facing identifier —
# falling back to the rendered title for steps materialized before the
# column existed), merges the key=value pairs into its metadata,
# completes it.
#
# - No open Job → NO-OP, exit 0. These scripts run outside regens all
#   the time; a build is not required to belong to one, and failing a
#   build because no Job is open would be the tail wagging the dog.
# - More than one open Job → exit 1. Guessing which to close is worse
#   than stopping.
# - Step already terminal → NO-OP, exit 0. Re-running a deploy inside
#   one regen must not fail: idempotence is the contract of a step's
#   status.
#
# Metadata is MERGED, never replaced. `PUT /api/jobs/{id}/steps/{id}`
# has PATCH semantics for top-level fields but swaps `metadata`
# wholesale, so sending only new keys silently wipes the rest —
# including `authority_role`, which is what keeps a gated step gated.
#
# Talks to jobs-api directly with an actor header, like
# feedback-queue.sh: the gateway is the browser edge and strips
# inbound `x-boss-*`, so terminal tooling cannot present itself there.
#
# All JSON parsing is jq with the payload on stdin and caller values
# passed via --arg, never spliced into the program text.
# feedback-queue.sh once embedded its parser in a double-quoted
# string and a literal double quote silently truncated the program.

# fallback is a silent redirect, and it ran for weeks: the backup,
# audit-integrity and ledger-replay timers each left 7 packets on
# boss-gcp's demo instance and ZERO on the cluster SoR, while firing
# exactly on schedule. Every check in `timers-leave-a-packet` passed
# the whole time, because none of them can see WHERE a packet lands.

# The estate model already knows: `service_instances.authoritative` is
# true for boss-cluster and false for boss-gcp-local. It was inert
# metadata — nothing consulted it, and a plausible default beat it.

# So: no default. A maintenance tool with no system of record
# configured refuses, loudly, and systemd records a failed unit — which
# is a state somebody notices, unlike a packet filed in the wrong
