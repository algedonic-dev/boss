# boss-step — close a step on the open Job of a given Workflow.

#   ./infra/boss-step.sh regenerate-deployment build source_ref=abc1234
#
# The point: work a machine did should be recorded by the machine that
# did it. A regen's `build` step closing because the build script
# finished is a fact; the same step closing because someone typed
# afterwards is a claim. The reason to model an operation as a Job is
# that its state stays true without anyone maintaining it.
#
# ## Behaviour
#
# Finds the single OPEN Job of `<workflow>`, finds the step by its
# spec slug (`steps.spec_slug`, the stable machine-facing identifier —
# falling back to the rendered title for steps materialized before the
# column existed), merges the key=value pairs into its metadata,
# completes it.
#
# - No open Job → NO-OP, exit 0. These scripts run outside regens all
#   the time; a build is not required to belong to one, and failing a
#   build because no Job is open would be the tail wagging the dog.
# - More than one open Job → exit 1. Guessing which to close is worse
#   than stopping.
# - Step already terminal → NO-OP, exit 0. Re-running a deploy inside
#   one regen must not fail: idempotence is the contract of a step's
#   status.
#
# Metadata is MERGED, never replaced. `PUT /api/jobs/{id}/steps/{id}`
# has PATCH semantics for top-level fields but swaps `metadata`
# wholesale, so sending only new keys silently wipes the rest —
# including `authority_role`, which is what keeps a gated step gated.
#
# Talks to jobs-api directly with an actor header, like
# feedback-queue.sh: the gateway is the browser edge and strips
# inbound `x-boss-*`, so terminal tooling cannot present itself there.
#
# All JSON parsing is jq with the payload on stdin and caller values
# passed via --arg, never spliced into the program text.
# feedback-queue.sh once embedded its parser in a double-quoted
# string and a literal double quote silently truncated the program.

# A VERDICT FOR THE RUN THAT JUST ENDED. systemd hands every
# ExecStopPost= process $SERVICE_RESULT (success / exit-code / timeout /
# signal / ...) and $EXIT_STATUS, and ExecStopPost runs whether ExecStart
# succeeded or not — unlike ExecStartPost, which systemd SKIPS when
# ExecStart fails. Until 2026-09-05 every timer completed its packet
# from ExecStartPost, so a failed run recorded nothing: the disk-floor
# sweep's 16:10 packet sat open through two FLOOR UNMET runs looking
# exactly like a run in progress, and forge-converge's 17:39 failure
# (exit 1) was closed "ok" by the next run's recovery. A packet that
# cannot say "failed" is not the record of the run.
#
# So when the caller passes no result of its own, the result IS the
# service result: `ok` for success (the word the outcome predicates
# route on), otherwise systemd's word for how it died, with the exit
# status beside it. An explicit result= pair still wins.

# WHAT THE RUN ITSELF RECORDED — the other half of the verdict.
#
# $SERVICE_RESULT says whether the run died; it cannot say what the run
# DID. boss-gcp-converge's packet carried `result=ok` and nothing else
# until 2026-09-11, and on the day an ops-runner install block landed that
# was enough to support the wrong conclusion: both converges had installed
# it, both packets said only "ok", and establishing which took an
# ops-request and 200 journal lines off the host (infra/run-summary.sh
# carries the measurement and the shape).
#
# So a unit may leave structured facts in $BOSS_RUN_SUMMARY_FILE — a path
# its unit declares ONCE, in `Environment=`, which both `ExecStart=` and
# this `ExecStopPost=` inherit, so producer and consumer cannot disagree
# about where it is (CLAUDE.md §9a). They merge onto the step UNDER the
# caller's explicit pairs, which still win.
#
# READ-AND-DELETE, and the file's absence is itself recorded. The run that
# wrote it has ended; leaving it would let the NEXT run's ExecStopPost
# stamp these facts on a packet they do not belong to — a stale record
# reads exactly as confident as a true one. `summary_absent` rather than
# silence for the same reason: "the run left no summary" is a finding, and
# the alternative is a packet that looks like every other packet.
#
# Kept as JSON rather than flattened to key=value pairs: an anomaly field
# holds the lines that caused it, verbatim, newlines and all, and a pair
# list cannot carry those without losing exactly the detail they are there
# for.
