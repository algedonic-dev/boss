# Cluster freshness check — is the cluster running what main says?
#
# THE INCIDENT
# ------------
# 2026-08-13. cluster-deploy-runner.sh applies the tree's manifests and
# THEN rolls the image, because boss.yaml carries a placeholder tag. A
# bug between those two steps aborted the run under `set -e`, so the
# cluster landed on the placeholder — an image several trains old — and
# stayed there. Nothing said so for hours:
#
#   * a failed systemd oneshot notifies nobody;
#   * the old image serves fine, so every health probe stayed green
#     (jobs door 200, playground 200, pod 1/1 Running);
#   * it is DRIFT, not an outage, and every alarm we had was shaped
#     for outages.
#
# It was found by accident, while reading an image tag for an unrelated
# reason. The fact was cheaply available the whole time and nobody was
# asking for it.
#
# THIS IS THE BINARY-FRESHNESS CHECK, ONE LAYER UP
# ------------------------------------------------
# check-binary-freshness.sh asks "is the deployed binary the thing we
# built" of the playground fleet. This asks the same question of the
# cluster: is the running image the one built from the head of the
# trunk. Same shape, same reason, different substrate.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
# ------------------------------------
# DECISIVE: the deployment's container image tag against the trunk's
# short sha. Equal means the cluster is running main. Unequal means it
# is not, whatever the health probes say.
#
# NOT PROVEN by the default reading: that the rollout finished, or that
# a pod is actually serving that image. The deployment spec reports the
# tag it WANTS. `--strict` additionally requires a pod's running image
# to match, which is the honest reading and needs a live pod — that is
# the gap `Recreate` opened during the same day's outage, where the
# spec moved and the pod could not start.
#
# Usage: infra/check-cluster-freshness.sh [--strict] [--self-test]
# Env:   KUBECONFIG, BOSS_TRUNK_REF (default: forge/main, then origin/main)
# Exit:  0 fresh / 1 stale or unreadable / 2 self-test failure

# Pure: the comparison, split out so it has a test that needs no
# cluster. Takes the deployed image ref and the trunk sha.
#
# Compared by PREFIX in both directions because the runner tags images
# with a short sha while git may hand back either length; a 7-char tag
# must match a 40-char trunk and vice versa. Both directions are
# checked so neither side's length is assumed.
