# Binary freshness check for the deployed boss-* fleet.
#
# Background: 2026-05-06 surfaced a stale-binary bug where the live
# /usr/local/bin/boss-brewery-sim was built 2026-05-04 against an
# older src/ snapshot — a `WARN` log line that had been demoted to
# `trace!` in source kept appearing in the deployed sim's logs,
# misleading anyone trying to triage. Other binaries on the box
# could be in the same state and we wouldn't notice.
#
# This script catches that. For every /usr/local/bin/boss-* it:
# TWO checks, because they prove different things and only one of
# them is decisive:
#
#   A. DEPLOYED vs BUILT — sha256 of the installed binary against
#      target/release/<name>. Decisive. Answers "is the thing running
#      the thing we built".
#   B. BUILT vs SOURCE — the binary's mtime against the newest commit
#      touching its crate. A heuristic, and it can lie.
#
# Check A exists because check B did lie, on 2026-08-07, during a
# schema regen. The deployed boss-brewery-sim had an mtime NEWER than
# the source change it was missing — a concurrent release build had
# compiled that crate early in the run and relinked it late, so the
# timestamp moved forward while the content did not. This script said
# "fresh"; `md5sum` against a fresh build said otherwise, and the
# behaviour change (a sim granularity fix) was silently absent on a
# running box. Five stale-binary incidents that day, and that was the
# one the tool built to catch them waved through.
#
# Neither check proves target/release itself is current — mtime is all
# there is without a rebuild. `--rebuild` does exactly that: builds
# first, so check A becomes decisive end-to-end. Slow, and the right
# thing before a regen.
#
# Exit code: 0 if everything is current, 1 if any drift is found.
#
# Usage:
#   ./infra/check-binary-freshness.sh
#   ./infra/check-binary-freshness.sh --rebuild        # decisive; slow
#   ./infra/check-binary-freshness.sh --bin-dir /opt/boss/target/release
#
# Notes:
#   - Falls back to a workspace-level "any crate moved" check for
#     binaries we can't map to a specific crate dir (rare, but the
#     fail-soft path beats false positives).
#   - The shipping bin name often differs from its crate name
#     (e.g. boss-brewery-sim ships from crates/tenants/
#     boss-brewery-engine). The mapping table below carries those
#     exceptions; everything else uses a heuristic
#     (boss-<x>-api → crates/*/boss-<x>).
