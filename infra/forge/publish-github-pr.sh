# publish-github-pr — open the public mirror's pull request BY MACHINE.
#
# The machine half of publish-to-github v6 (design 7b59af2c, David
# 2026-09-08: the mirror at github.com/algedonic-dev/boss is "strictly a
# backup of source protocol" and the PR "should open from our dauld
# GitHub account"). When David signs the protocol's approve step, the
# dispatcher rule publish-github-pr-on-open-pr-ready files an
# ops-request for the forge host, and the root ops-runner runs THIS
# script with no arguments. It:
#
#   1. finds the one open publish-to-github packet whose `open-pr` step
#      is ready (one mirror, one open packet — the daily rule's guard);
#   2. fetches forge main from the Forgejo repository ON THIS HOST (a
#      path, no forge credential) and the mirror's main from GitHub
#      (anonymous; the repo is public);
#   3. builds the dated SNAPSHOT commit: `git commit-tree <forge main
#      tree> -p <mirror main>`. The mirror's history is publish
#      snapshots, not the forge's history — a merge of forge main
#      conflicts in hundreds of files (measured 553 on 2026-09-08), and
#      a snapshot whose tree IS forge main's tree is the honest backup;
#   4. pushes it to the dauld fork as publish/<date> (recreating the
#      fork once if it is gone), opens the PR against algedonic-dev/boss
#      as dauld, and completes the packet's open-pr step with pr_url.
#
# THE MERGE ON GITHUB STAYS DAVID'S — the second gate. Nothing here
# touches the mirror's main.
#
# THE TOKEN. dauld's GitHub token is provisioned by David's token admin
# at $BOSS_GITHUB_TOKEN_FILE (default /etc/boss-publish/github.token,
# root:root 0600, one line) and declared in the credentials registry
# (id dauld-github-token). This script only ever READS it, hands it to
# git through a credential helper and to gh through GH_TOKEN on those
# two child processes, and never prints it. A missing or world-readable
# token file is a loud refusal naming the path — never a silent skip.
#
# --check: validate inputs (tools, token file, forge repository, state
# dir) with no network and exit 0/1. What the gate lint runs. It also
# PERFORMS the forge fetch, into a throwaway repository it deletes,
# because that fetch's permission model differs from a direct read and a
# --check that does not run it passes where the publish fails — which is
# what happened on 2026-09-11 (--check ok at 13:41, publish FAILED at
# 13:43 on the same host, mirror 271 commits behind).
#
# Idempotent: re-running the same day force-updates publish/<date> on
# the fork and reuses an already-open PR for that head. A verb killed
# mid-way leaves at worst a pushed branch on our own fork.
#
# Runs as root under the ops-runner with NO HOME: every path is explicit
# (state dir, GH_CONFIG_DIR) and nothing reads $HOME.

# Until 2026-09-11 this was one hardcoded default,
# /opt/forgejo/data/git/repositories/david/boss.git, and that string
# appeared EXACTLY ONCE in the tree — here — with the only other
# references being test overrides that substitute a tmpdir. So it had
# never been run against the real host, and the verb's real run had
# never succeeded: ops-request 04975694 ran `--check` on the forge and
# the repository path was its one and only failure (backlog ed84b5d9).
#
# Forgejo runs on that host as a container (codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo
# :16.0.2, measured on ops-request aa0118a6, 2026-09-11) and its compose
# file DECLARES which host directory is mounted at the container's
# /data. That declaration is the one definition of where the
# repositories live, so read it (CLAUDE.md §9a: one definition, never a
# second copy in a shell default). Inside /data, the repository root is
# Forgejo's OWN `[repository] ROOT` from app.ini when that is readable;
# git/repositories is only the image's default.
#
# Every layer is reported by --check, labelled with where it came from,
# so the next reader never has to guess which one answered.
# BOSS_FORGE_REPO_PATH overrides the lot.

# The host directory bound to the container's /data. Compose's short
# syntax (`- ./data:/data[:ro]`) and long syntax (`source:`/`target:`)

# ownership" — the same refusal, measured on this host class on
# ops-request c9877f75 (2026-09-10), that made delete-orphan-object's
# read impossible. That script drops to the owner instead; this one
# cannot, because the fetch's DESTINATION is root's own state dir under
# /var/lib, which the owner cannot write. The hazard the drop protects
# against — a root WRITE leaving root-owned objects in somebody else's
# repository — is not reachable here: a fetch only reads the source, and
# nothing in this script writes under $FORGE_REPO. That is also why the
# exemption names $FORGE_REPO exactly and never `*`: it is right for a
# READER and wrong where root writes, which is why
# infra/forge/delete-orphan-object.sh rejects it by name.
#
# WHY A FILE AND NOT `-c safe.directory=…`. Until 2026-09-11 it was the
# `-c` form, and `-c` CANNOT exempt a fetch SOURCE. A local fetch runs
# `git upload-pack` IN THE SOURCE REPOSITORY, and git clears the
# command-line config when it crosses into another repository — git's own
# trace says so, verbatim:
#
#   run_command: unset GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS … git-upload-pack '<src>'
#
# so that child runs its ownership check with no exemption at all. A
# DIRECT read in this process does honour `-c`, which is exactly how
# `--check` passed while the publish failed. Measured three ways on git
# 2.39.5, one destination exempted by a protected file so the only
# variable was how the SOURCE was exempted:
#
#   source via `-c` only (the old shape)  exit 128, dubious ownership
#   source via GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL file     the fetch succeeds
#   source not exempted (control)         exit 128, dubious ownership
#
# GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL is protected configuration AND is not in the set git
# clears crossing repositories, so the child inherits it. The file lives
# in $workdir — per-run, 0700, removed by the trap — never a fixed path
# under /tmp that another run or another user could have planted.

# A SIXTH REFUSAL — the fork must be a fork OF THE MIRROR, not merely a
# name that resolves. Until 2026-09-11 this asked `gh repo view
# "$FORK_SLUG" --json name`, which proves only that SOMETHING answers to
# that name. On 2026-09-11 something did: dauld/boss, David's unrelated
# private repository, outside algedonic-dev/boss's fork network entirely.
# So the auto-fork below was skipped (the repository "existed"), the
# snapshot was pushed into the wrong repository, and the failure surfaced
# one step later as four GraphQL errors that name no cause. CLAUDE.md
# §Doors, "a wrong target answers instead of erroring", and its corollary:
# before concluding something exists, ask a question whose answer
# distinguishes it from its namesake.
#
# The question is therefore the RELATIONSHIP. GitHub's REST repository
# object answers it in two fields — `parent.full_name` is what a fork was
# forked FROM, `source.full_name` is the root of its whole network, so a
# fork of a fork of the mirror still answers the mirror — and `gh api` is
# the stable way to read them. Three outcomes, three different things to
# do, and each says which one it took:
#
#   absent (404)       the auto-fork's case, and the only one it was ever
#                      written for. It forks UNDER $FORK_SLUG's own name
#                      (--fork-name): `gh repo fork` otherwise names the
#                      new fork after the upstream, which on this account
#                      is dauld/boss — the repository that caused this.
#   present, unrelated REFUSED, naming both slugs and what the repository
#                      says about itself. Never a push: the push is the
#                      one step here that puts our commit somewhere we did
#                      not choose, and it cannot be taken back from here.
#   present, a fork of the mirror — proceed, saying so.
