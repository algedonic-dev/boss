# disk-report.sh — what is consuming this host's disk, READ-ONLY. It
# serves the forge and boss-gcp (infra/ops/verbs/disk-report.json);
# every section skips what the host does not have, so one script reads
# both.
#
# BOSS-GCP (backlog d3c7eada, 2026-09-26). boss-gcp's 48 GB root sat at
# 11-13 GB free for nine days under its 17 GB floor, and the only disk
# verb serving it was `df` — so what filled the root could not be read
# through a door. The residue suspected there is the retired second
# stack (ops-request 7912c9ae left its unit files and binaries, and put
# its database capture under /var/backups/boss/second-stack/), so the
# fixed list carries /var/backups and /usr/local, and /var/backups,
# /opt, /home and /var/lib are also read one level down. That host
# mounts its builds (/var/lib/boss-build, sdc) and postgres (sdb) UNDER
# /var/lib, so a directory that is a mount point is marked as its own
# filesystem: its size says nothing about the root the alarm is about.
#
# WHY. On 2026-09-05 the locomotive refused train #204 at 65GB free
# against its 70GB floor; the bounded reclaim (disk-floor-sweep.sh)
# pruned every regenerable cache it is allowed to touch and stopped at
# exactly 70GB with "a human decides next" — and nobody could say what
# held the other 158GB of a 228GB disk, because no door from the dev
# pod reads this host's filesystem: the forge token has no package
# scope, gatewayd serves journals only, and the ops verb allowlist had
# no report verb. David: "I want to understand what is consuming disk
# first. If we can't do the investigation from here, I want to discuss
# how we add that capability as we go." This is that capability, in
# the shape the allowlist demands: one fixed script, no arguments,
# nothing mutated.
#
# WHAT IT READS. This host runs TWO docker daemons (reap-dead-ci-jobs
# header): the system daemon that Forgejo Actions jobs run in (`sudo
# docker`), and david's rootless daemon that the converge builds in.
# disk-floor-sweep prunes only the rootless one, so the system daemon's
# images, build cache and job volumes are the first suspect. Then a
# fixed list of directories, largest first. `sudo -n` is tried where
# root is needed and the line says so when it was refused, so a
# reader can tell "small" from "unreadable".

hr "verdict"
# THE READING CARRIES ITS VERDICT (backlog 970c0c94, measured
# 2026-09-18). The disk-headroom sweep files this report for itself the
# moment its Inspect step becomes ready (measure-disk-headroom-sweep-on-
# inspect-ready) and the answer landed as free text: exit 0 at 68% root
# exactly as it would at 99%, so nothing could complete the sweep's
# Inspect step by rule and four of them sat assigned to the agent for a
# day with a clean number on another packet. The report carries ONE
# machine-readable verdict line — `verdict: clean` or `verdict:
# <finding>` — that the dispatcher rule judge-disk-headroom-sweep-on-
# report-answered reads (maintenance.sweep.judge, which takes the LAST
# `verdict: ` line; there is only this one). The exit code stays 0
# either way: a finding is an answer, not a failure.
#
# IT PRINTS FIRST, NOT LAST (backlog 8fcd25c4, measured 2026-09-26). It
# used to close the report, after the per-directory lists; on boss-gcp
# those lists, now read one level down, outlasted the ops-runner's 30s
# default and the kill (exit 124, ops-request b21ddeb3) landed before
# the verdict was written. The verdict needs only `df -k /`, so it is
# read here, before anything slow: a kill now cuts the lists, never the
# verdict. The verb also declares its own timeout (disk-report.json),
# and the judge still reads a killed verb as unmeasured whatever its
# output says — this ordering is so a human reading a killed report
# still sees the number.
#
# THE FLOOR IS THE ESTATE'S, NOT A NEW NUMBER. It is the same rule the
# estate comparator applies to every observed host —
# max(DISK_TIGHT_FLOOR_GB, min(DISK_TIGHT_FLOOR_PCT of capacity,
# DISK_TIGHT_HEADROOM_CEILING_GB)) — read from the same `df -k /` the
# host observer takes (infra/estate/observe-host.sh, nearest GiB). A
# shell script cannot read a Rust `const`, so the three numbers are
# PINNED to crates/orchestrators/boss-dispatcher-handlers/src/handlers/
# estate_compare.rs by `the_disk_report_judges_by_the_comparators_floor`,
# which names whichever moved (CLAUDE.md §9a: a pin is what you write
# when you cannot collapse today). If the floor ever lands in one
# registry both readers should read it and the pin should go.
