# mirror-base-images — copy the CI build's external base images into the
# forge registry so `build-image` resolves NO public DNS (backlog
# 7f408b99). The gcr.io / docker.io lookups the build depends on flaked
# repeatedly (#236, #250: `lookup gcr.io on 127.0.0.53:53: no such
# host`) and reddened trains; mirroring moves that DNS dependency off
# the every-train hot path and onto this occasional, retryable job.
# Trains then pull the base images from 10.20.0.15:3000 (the forge host
# itself), which needs no external resolver.
#
# BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION, like disk-floor-sweep.sh (verbs.json _about):
# the set of images is a FIXED in-tree list below, never a packet-
# supplied name. The `mirror-base-images` ops-verb runs THIS script with
# no arguments; a packet cannot ask it to pull or push anything else.
# The forge tags produced here are the exact refs ci.yml's `image:` and
# infra/forge/boss-ci/Dockerfile's `FROM`s point at — one source of
# truth, pinned by infra/lint/the-build-pulls-only-mirrored-bases.sh.
#
# AUTH. The one proven registry-push path on the forge host is david's
# rootless docker with its ambient registry login (see
# cluster-deploy-runner.sh). This script runs under the ops-runner as
# ROOT, so it points the docker CLI at david's socket AND david's
# docker config explicitly — otherwise root's own (unauthenticated)
# config is read and the push 401s. Both are overridable; failure is
# LOUD (a non-zero exit naming the image and step), never silent, so the
# ops-request records exactly what broke.

# these five were what was left running in the cluster straight off
# docker.io and gcr.io -- nats on the bus, caddy on the TLS front,
# alpine/k8s and lego on the certificate chain, and the cloud SDK the
# nightly backup ships with. A resolver stall or a rate limit on any of
