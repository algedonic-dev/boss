# sweep-archive-branches — delete the forge branches whose cars landed
# BEFORE the database switch, on TWO sources of evidence — the ARCHIVE
# database's job records, by exactly the rule the arriving train's
# sweep applies, and the forge's own PULL-REQUEST ANCESTRY — and record
# what went, what was kept, and why.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (backlog dfd83788, measured 2026-09-17 06:30Z on the pod)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# `boss orient` listed 50 forge heads no packet claims. The arrival
# sweep deletes a landed car's branch on the JOB RECORD's evidence
# (crates/orchestrators/boss-cli/src/train.rs: `deletable_branches`
# proves the content landed — a closed car with outcome `merged` —
# and `sweep_guard` proves the branch still holds only that content —
# its head on the forge equals the head recorded at boarding). Every
# car that landed before the 2026-09-16 23:55Z switch
# (switch-instance-database.sh) lives in the ARCHIVE database, not in
# the system of record the sweep reads, so the sweep will never see
# them and those branches are permanent by construction. `boss merged`
# over all 50 could judge only 9 by content (train PRs squash-merge, so
# ancestry never proves a landing); the evidence that decides them is
# the archive's job records, readable through the kubectl-exec psql
# door tenant-census.sh already uses. So: one bounded verb, the
# arrival sweep's own rule, applied to the archive's records.
#
# THE RULE, which is the sweep's and is not loosened here. A branch
# comes off iff
#   - the archive holds a `ship-a-change` job with status `closed` and
#     metadata.outcome `merged` that NAMES it: metadata.branch with
#     metadata.boarded_head, or an entry of metadata.rerail_origins
#     with its branch and head (train.rs `recorded_branches` — the
#     rerail original is the second half, packet 473fda1b);
#   - AND the branch's current head on the forge EQUALS the recorded
#     head (train.rs `sweep_guard`: car 23923b40 is what the head guard
#     costs when it is missing — two commits pushed after boarding,
#     deleted on a job record that was entirely correct).
# Everything else is KEPT and NAMED: a head that differs is `moved`
# (the commits live nowhere else); a claim with no recorded head is
# `no head` (an unknown head is not evidence); a forge head no
# archive car claims is `unrecorded` — an abandoned attempt, or a
# branch never filed as a car: a human's decision, listed for one. A
# claim whose branch is not on the forge is `gone`: COUNTED, never
# named — a gone branch is nothing to act on and its name carries
# nothing (train.rs `sweep_note`, job 1bd1fb3d).
#
# THE SECOND SOURCE (backlog 2c10a25d, measured 2026-09-17 08:00Z)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The first dry run (ops-request 54547b33) planned 6 of the 50 orphans:
# the archive holds a closed, merged car for only those 6, because the
# cars of trains #384–#411 closed (or tried to) inside the converge
# hold and after the database switch, so NO database recorded their
# landing. The forge did. Forgejo keeps `refs/pull/N/head` for every
# PR; a train PR N is the assembled consist, squash-merged as one main
# commit whose subject ends `(#N)`; so a branch head that is an
# ANCESTOR of `refs/pull/N/head` for a MERGED N landed with that train
# (37 of the 50, by `git merge-base --is-ancestor` on the pod). This
# evidence survives every cutover and needs no database, so it rides
# beside the archive's: a forge head the archive did not plan is
# planned with `evidence: "pull-request", pr: N` when a merged PR's
# head contains it — the NEWEST such N. A head that is also in an OPEN
# PR is still deletable when a merged one contains it (merged wins); a
# head ONLY in unmerged PRs is not evidence. The archive's evidence is
# untouched: a branch it plans is `evidence: "archive"`.
#
# THE SAME GUARD applies to both. The archive's rule compares the
# recorded head to the forge's; for PR evidence the recorded head IS
# the forge's head that proved ancestry, so the guard reduces to "still
# points there at delete time" — and that is now what the forge is
# asked, for every delete: `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<b>:<head>`
# makes the delete conditional on the ref still being at the head the
# evidence vouches for. A branch that moves between the read and the
# push is refused by the forge (`stale info`), recorded `failed`, and
# read back still there.
#
# TWO DEFECTS THE SAME RUN SHOWED, fixed here. (1) The record named
# all 1,014 GONE branches — 184 KB — and the runner kept 102,400 bytes
# (OPS_OUTPUT_CAP), so the unrecorded list was cut off the packet.
# Gone is a COUNT now: `gone=<n>` on the verdict and `gone` in the
# record, no list; a test holds a record with 1,000 gone claims and 50
# heads under 100,000 bytes. (2) The `unrecorded` set held the LIVE
# system of record's own open cars' branches, because the verb read
# only the archive. It now reads the live open `ship-a-change` cars
# through `boss-sor-read` (infra/forge/probe-bin — the reader the
# recorded probes use, on this host by construction) as a read-scoped
# actor, and a forge head an open car names is `live`: counted and
# named, never unrecorded, never planned — even where PR ancestry
# would call it landed, because a follow-up car branched from a landed
# head is live work. A live record that cannot be read is a REFUSAL:
# unreadable live = cannot tell live from stale, and a wrong target
# answers instead of erroring (CLAUDE.md §Doors).
#
# THE DECISION (backlog a12736b1, measured 2026-09-18)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The for-real sweep (ops-request e96e5e60) deleted the 40 it could
# prove landed; the dry run after it (a2d0b0fc) still kept 10 — 2
# moved, 8 unrecorded — "a human's decision". The human had decided:
# design 7fc3970b, answered on packet 2604d814's design-review by
# David, "Delete them all". The decision was on the record and the
# verb had no door to carry it out, so the 10 would have needed a hand
# `git push --delete` — the by-hand act the doors exist to replace. So
# an OPTIONAL FOURTH ARGUMENT names the decision: a full job id. The
# verb READS that packet from the system of record through the same
# reader as the live cars and requires, in this order: the packet
# exists; it is a `backlog-item` or a `design-doc`; it has a review
# step (`design-review` on a backlog-item, `review` on a design-doc —
# the workflow's step titles, read as the step's `spec_slug`); that
# step is `completed`; it is not `declined` (a decision AGAINST is not
# a licence); and it carries an `answer` or `resolutions` (a decision
# with no words is not one). Anything else is REFUSED naming the
# packet and the missing fact, and nothing is deleted — not even the
# archive-planned set, so the operator reads one refusal, never half a
# sweep. With a qualifying decision the `moved`, `no head` and
# `unrecorded` branches are planned too, `evidence: "decision"`, each
# leased to the head the forge holds and read back like the rest, and
# named `by decision <id>`. EVERY PROTECTION STANDS: a live car's
# branch is never a candidate, `main` is never a candidate, and — read
# only when a decision is given, because only then is an unrecorded
# branch ever planned — an OPEN pr-train's `train/*` branch (its
# subject id, train.rs `train_branch_to_delete`) is `live` too. A
# dry run with a decision plans the decided set and pushes nothing.
#
# THE BOUNDS, in the order they are applied — each refuses loudly and
# names the bound; a refusal changes nothing:
#
#   1. THE ARGUMENTS. `--dry-run` or `--for-real`, a namespace of the
#      shape instances.toml admits (`boss` or `boss-<name>`; never
#      boss-dev, the pipeline's), a database name that is a plain
#      lowercase identifier — so it is never quoted, escaped or split —
#      and, optionally, a decision that is a full lowercase job uuid,
#      so it is the one path segment `/api/jobs/<id>` and nothing else.
#      The allowlist checks these first; the script re-checks rather
#      than relying on one layer (the retire-second-stack convention).
#   2. THE ARCHIVE IS NOT THE LIVE DATABASE. Secret `boss-secrets` key
#      `database-url` in the namespace is parsed in a variable (the
#      switch verb's parsing, copied); every line printed names
#      user@host:port/db — THE PASSWORD IS NEVER PRINTED, on any path,
#      and a test asserts it. The database that Secret names is the
#      live system of record, and the LIVE sweep owns it: asking to
#      sweep from it is refused. A Secret that cannot be read or
#      parsed is a refusal, never a pass; a host that is not the
#      instance's postgres Service is refused, because the read below
#      goes through sts/postgres in the namespace.
#   3. THE RECORD. ONE psql round trip (json_agg) through the same
#      kubectl-exec door the census uses, the session set read-only in
#      its own -c before the query — the archive is never written.
#      An archive that cannot be read is a refusal.
#   4. THE FORGE. The heads are read with `git ls-remote --heads
#      forgejo` in the converged checkout — the remote the converge
#      itself fetches through (cluster-deploy-lib.sh, tenant_source_
#      check). That remote's URL may carry a token in its userinfo, so
#      THE URL IS NEVER PRINTED and every git message is redacted
#      before it reaches the packet (the lib's redact_url shape). A
#      forge that cannot be read is a refusal. The checkout is a
#      user's and the ops-runner is root, so git runs as the
#      directory's owner (delete-orphan-object.sh's as_owner).
#   5. THE LIVE RECORD. `boss-sor-read` reads the open ship-a-change
#      cars (one listing, limit 200) as a read-scoped `audit-readonly`
#      actor — the identity boss prove --unattended builds for a probe, for
#      the same reason: an unidentified reader is answered a NARROWER
#      WORLD in silence (backlog 61085a9e). The reader missing,
#      refusing, answering the wrong shape, or answering a listing cut
#      at its limit (`total` above what came back) is a refusal. With
#      a decision: the open pr-trains too (same reader, same bounds),
#      and then the decision packet itself, judged as above — a
#      packet the record does not hold, or holds without a completed,
#      worded, undeclined review, is a refusal that names it.
#   6. THE PULL REQUESTS. One fetch through the same remote, under the
#      checkout's lock (checkout-lock.sh — one lock for every git user
#      of the forge checkout): every `refs/heads/*` and every
#      `refs/pull/*/head` into this verb's own namespace
#      `refs/sweep-archive-branches/`, never into refs/remotes or the
#      worktree. Measured on the pod, 417 PRs: the one fetch is 0.3 s,
#      incremental after; ls-remote plus a fetch per sha is 417 round
#      trips. The merged set is the `(#N)` subjects on the FETCHED
#      main. Ancestry is one `git for-each-ref --contains <head>` over
#      the pull namespace per forge head (24 ms each). A fetch that
#      fails is a refusal.
#   7. THE NAME. A branch name is data the forge handed back; only a
#      name of the shape `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._/-]*` is ever handed
#      to git, and always as the full ref `refs/heads/<name>` so it can
#      never read as an option. A deletable branch whose name is
#      outside that shape is kept and named `unsafe name`.
#
# Then, `--for-real` only: `git push forgejo --delete
# --force-with-lease=refs/heads/<b>:<head> refs/heads/<b>` for each
# planned branch, each one READ BACK with ls-remote — a forge answer
# is not a forge effect — and recorded as `deleted` (absent on
# read-back) or `failed` (the push refused, or the ref still there).
# The dry run prints the same plan and pushes nothing.
#
# OUTPUT ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING (backlog 5323f3ef: the ops-runner keeps
# the first 100 KB of a verb's output, OPS_OUTPUT_CAP). The VERDICT
# LINE PRINTS FIRST — `sweep-archive-branches: <mode> archive=<db>
# recorded=<n> planned=<n> by_archive=<n> by_pr=<n> [by_decision=<n>]
# deleted=<n> moved=<n> unrecorded=<n> live=<n> gone=<n>
# [decision=<id>]` (the bracketed fields only when a decision was
# given) — then the ONE JSON record line on stdout, then the
# per-branch lines, so a cut listing never costs the verdict. In a dry
# run `deleted` is 0 by construction and `planned` is the count the
# real run would delete.

# whose current sha a MERGED pull request's head contains is planned
# on that evidence, the newest such PR named — so a claim the archive
# saw as `moved` or `no head` lands on PR evidence when the forge's
# head is in a merged consist, and an unclaimed head does the same.
