# cluster-deploy-lib — the parts of the cluster converge that decide
# WHERE the cluster lands, as functions a stub kubectl can exercise.
# Sourced by cluster-deploy-runner.sh; tested by
# infra/lint/the-converge-rolls-back-to-a-named-build.sh on every gate.
#
# WHY. On 2026-09-05 a head bricked its boot and the runner's guard
# fired correctly — then rolled back to PRE_REV, the revision its own
# `kubectl apply` had just created from the manifest's literal image
# tag: a month-old build whose jobs API cannot start against today's
# registry. The cluster stayed dark for four hours on a "rollback" that
# rolled to the wrong place (packet: the converge rolls back to the
# manifest's placeholder). CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: "roll back" is a
# TARGET, not a verb. The target is the last CONVERGED build — the sha
# the runner itself stamps after every successful roll — named by image,
# verified Ready.
#
# Two more things follow from the same night. The manifest's image
# field is a placeholder the apply step used to put on the cluster for
# the seconds between apply and patch — a dark window on an old build
# on every converge; `manifests_with_image` writes the converged sha
# into the applied copy instead, so the apply never changes what runs.
# And a head that cannot even find what its launcher sources should
# never reach the cluster: `image_boots` runs the image's own launcher
# check before anything is applied.

# THE CONVERGE APPLIES `*.yaml` AND NOTHING ELSE — one definition, two
# readers (backlog e37a833d).
#
# `manifests_with_image` stages the apply directory with
# `cp "$src"/*.yaml`, so a manifest committed as `.yml` or `.json`, filed
# in a subdirectory, or named with a leading dot is in the tree,
# reviewed, merged — and never reaches the cluster. Nothing said so: no
# lint, no converge warning, and `kubectl apply` has no `--prune`, so
# nothing downstream can see the omission either. That is a change that
# looks delivered and is not, and it is indistinguishable from a manifest
# that has merely not converged YET.
#
# `.yaml` stays the only legal name rather than the converge widening,
# because SEVEN readers derive "what the tree declares to the cluster"
# from this directory, each with its own `*.yaml` (undeclared-objects.sh,
# check-manifests-applied.sh, the orphan lint's properties A and B,
# a-workload-declares-the-user-it-runs-as.sh, timers-leave-a-packet.sh
# twice, and this function). Widening leaves all seven free to disagree
# about the set; refusing makes `*.yaml` select the WHOLE directory, so
# they are equal by construction instead of by seven edits or seven pins
# (CLAUDE.md §9a prefers the collapse).
#
# manifests_the_converge_ignores DIR
#   Print every entry of DIR that `cp "$DIR"/*.yaml` would leave behind,
#   one path per line. Nothing printed = the converge applies the whole
#   directory. `*.md` is documentation and not a declaration, so it is
#   the one thing deliberately not applied; everything else — `.yml`,
#   `.json`, a nested directory, a dotfile that `*` never expands onto —
#   is something the apply drops on the floor.
#
#   Read by infra/lint/a-manifest-the-converge-ignores-is-refused.sh,
#   which is how this never fires in a converge: it fails the gate first.

# PROVISIONING MINTS AN INSTANCE'S OWN SECRETS (backlog dc1bc724; David
# 2026-09-16: no hand work unless absolutely required). The gate above

# was skipped on every converge from 2026-09-15 for want of that
# ceremony. Measured against its render (six names, five keys), the
# six are not one kind of thing, and only one of them is a person's:
#
#   internal  boss-secrets (postgres-password, admin-password, and
#             database-url composed from the password and the
#             instance's OWN postgres Service), boss-session-key —
#             random bytes NOBODY needs to know. Minted here, once,
#             when absent; the values ride kubectl's stdin, never its
#             argv and never this journal (names only).
#   shared    forgejo-registry (the registry pull credential), resend
#             (the mail sender) — the SAME credential as the source
#             instance's. Copied from the namespace instances.toml
#             names as `shares_with`: type and data, none of the
#             source object's identity. No `shares_with`: left absent,
#             named, and the gate names them to a person.
#   root      boss-oidc (client-secret) — the Kanidm OIDC client the
#             identity provider issues; the estate cannot mint it.
#             MEASURED in boss-gateway oidc.rs OidcConfig::from_env: an
#             EMPTY client secret is "no OIDC" and the gateway boots
#             with guest sessions and local auth; an ABSENT Secret
#             wedges the pod (the ref is not optional). So the object
#             is created with every key the manifests read present and
#             EMPTY — the way ensure_declared_secrets creates a broker
#             Secret — and the ceremony that registers the client fills
#             it. Until then the instance is guest-only, which is what
#             a public example needs.
#   by hand   everything else — today boss-tls, the lego certificate,

#             the tunnel). Not created; the gate still names it.

# THE TUNNEL CONNECTOR REPORTS AFTER THE ROLL (backlog 5a2bb0ce; design

# workload (infra/cluster/manifests/cloudflared.yaml). Its credentials
# are one Secret minted once by David; the connector is applied with
# prod's manifests whether or not that Secret exists, and prod's apply
# has no secret gate (the gate above is for a SECOND instance). So the
# converge reads the connector's state after the roll and puts it on
# the packet, where the car's probe reads it — never in the journal
# alone (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: a check nobody reads is not running).

# THE TENANT SOURCE PER INSTANCE (backlog f4f5c387, car 2 of fcc1d57b;
# David 2026-09-16 'Let's do it'). An instance's tenant is either a
# directory the image ships or a repository on the forge that this
# converge checks out beside the product and delivers as the
# `boss-tenant` ConfigMap — infra/cluster/instances.toml says which,
# and render-instance.sh --instances carries the repo and ref as its
# seventh and eighth columns (and the instance's optional site as the
# ninth). The functions below are the repo half, written so a fixture
# forge can exercise every verdict.
#
# ONE CREDENTIAL: the checkout's own. The runner fetches forge main
# through its `forgejo` remote, and the tenant is read with exactly
# that URL's scheme and host — the repo path replaced, nothing else —
# so the first converge MEASURES whether the checkout's token can read
# the tenant repo, and an unreadable one names itself on the packet
# instead of a person guessing at scopes. The token is not IN that URL
# any more (design 1c90d183, backlog c4cbc6b5): it is a 0600 file of
# the owner's behind a git credential helper in the owner's GLOBAL
# config, scoped to the forge's URL, and forge-converge's deposit
# (credential-deposit.sh) strips the remote's userinfo once that helper
# authenticates. The runner runs as that owner (User= in its unit), so
# a derived URL for any repo on the forge authenticates through the same
# file. The URL is derived as the remote holds it rather than stripped
# here: the runner's first tick after the change lands precedes the
# deposit's first pass, and a URL stripped before the helper exists
# would record a false "tenant source unreadable". No URL ever reaches
# the journal regardless — a remote the deposit has not converted still
# carries its token in the userinfo — and every git message is redacted
# before it is printed.

# _tenant_url_from_remote URL TENANT_REPO — pure string work: the

# takes the system of record down until the delivered file is fixed,
# and the watchdog rolls back IMAGES, not ConfigMaps. The 2026-09-07
# class one layer out: a boot guard that refuses to start takes the
# SoR down. So the converge judges the checkout with the product's
# own loaders — `boss tenant check`, the tree's CLI that install.sh
# takes out of the image on every tick (backlog 9f00a805) — BEFORE the
# ConfigMap is applied, and a refusal keeps the previous ConfigMap:
# the software converges, the tenant does not, and the packet says

#   root files that never stage and cannot fail it (UNKNOWN). Three
#   verdicts, never two:
#     rc 0  every file passed; nothing printed.
#     rc 1  REFUSED — prints `<path>:<line>` for the first MISSING or
#           INVALID row (`<path>` alone when the loader named no
#           line), the verb's whole report on stderr for the journal
#           and in REPORT when one is named (the packet carries it).
#     rc 3  COULD NOT CHECK — the CLI is not on this host, or it died
#           without a verdict (any exit but 0 and 1, or a 1 with no
#           refused row). Named on stderr. A caller treats it as a

# instances_skipped_by_gate K KM SOURCE_NS INSTANCES MOUNT
#   The packet's `instances_skipped` string as the secret gate would
#   decide it NOW: instance_secret_gate asked for every instance but
#   the source, WRITING NOTHING — the reads the apply loop makes,
#   without the apply. INSTANCES is render-instance.sh --instances
#   (name<TAB>namespace<TAB>…); MOUNT is the rendered directory as KM
#   sees it. Prints the string (empty when nothing is skipped) and
#   returns 0; returns 2 when a read could not be made — the string is
#   then not knowable, and the caller must not guess one.
#   A repo-sourced instance (seventh column) with NO boss-tenant
#   ConfigMap in its namespace is skipped too (backlog f4f5c387): the
#   deploying tick delivers the ConfigMap before it applies, so its
#   absence means the instance was never applied — skipped over an
#   unreadable tenant, or not yet converged — and its hostname must
#   stay served by the source (the 40d46042 shape). The tick does not
#   re-measure readability: that is the deploying tick's finding, and
#   the cluster's state is what this read-only tick may ask.
# THE COLUMNS OF `render-instance.sh --instances` ARE TAB-SEPARATED AND
# MAY BE EMPTY. `IFS=$'\t' read` cannot read them: a tab is whitespace
# to `read`, and a run of whitespace delimiters collapses into one, so
# an empty column DISAPPEARS and every column after it shifts left.
# Measured 2026-09-16 23:34Z on the first converge after the prod flip
# (c7be253): prod's empty `shares_with` column shifted `tenant_repo`
# into `tenant_ref`, the runner asked the forge for repository `main`
# and answered `tenant_source: boss: unreadable (main@)` — nothing
# rolled, prod stayed on its old database while the Secret already
# named the new one. Every reader of the list goes through this: the
# tabs become a non-whitespace separator (ASCII 31, unit separator),
# which `read` keeps even when empty.

# EVERY TICK OBSERVES THE SITE, beside the connector (backlog e114238a;
# design b64c4377). Site ops by protocol — the tenant workflow
# publish-the-landing-page in david/algedonic-llc — closes its loop on
# the converge's RECORD of what it served, never on a belief: the
# publish step records `site_hash` = sha256 of site/index.html at the
# merge, and the dispatcher rule jobs.complete_step_matching completes
# the `live` step when a closed converge's run step carries the same
# value at `steps.run.site.hash`. So the converge reads the page the
# way a visitor's request reaches the gateway — `/` with `Host:
# <site>`, the header the tunnel connector forwards unchanged — and
# hashes the BODY it received, byte for byte. That equality holds
# because the gateway serves the file's bytes as read and rewrites
# nothing (boss-gateway site.rs `answer`, pinned by its own test), and
# because the body goes to a FILE here, never through a shell variable
# that would strip a trailing newline or choke on a NUL.
#
# THE REACH is measured, not assumed: the instance's gateway Service
# is a LoadBalancer (boss.yaml; prod pinned to 10.20.0.30, another
# instance's assigned by the pool), and its address is read off the
# live object — the same LAN the watchdog reaches the jobs API over
# (cluster-watchdog.sh, 10.20.0.34). Nothing here goes through the
# tunnel: an observation of the edge would be an observation of
# Cloudflare, and the fact the loop rests on is what the GATEWAY
# serves.
#
# NEVER FATAL, NEVER FAKED. The site is not what a train delivers, so
# an unreachable gateway records `unreachable (<curl's own words>)` and
# the tick goes on; a 404 (a tenant with no site/ yet) records the 404
# and the hash of THAT body — the status is the reader's to judge. An

# A DECLARED BROKER SECRET IS CREATED EMPTY WHEN IT IS ABSENT (backlog
# 51c98681; David 2026-09-16: no hand work unless absolutely required,
# and an empty object declared in the registry is not a credential).
#
# The credential broker's install phase PATCHes a value into its Secret
# and is deliberately NOT granted `create` — it cannot be name-scoped in
# RBAC, so the grant would be namespace-wide (boss-credential-broker.yaml).
# That left one hand act at the head of every machine rotation: "the
# Secret is pre-created empty, out-of-band, once". For the forge token
# it was done by hand; for the tunnel credential nobody had, so the
# connector waited in ContainerCreating and every converge recorded
# `cloudflared: skipped (secret absent: cloudflare-tunnel-credentials)`
# with nothing that would ever change it. The converge holds the admin
# credential, so the empty object is its to create — and ONLY the empty
# object: a value is the broker's, and a Secret that exists is never
# touched, whatever it holds.
#
# WHICH SECRETS is the broker's own declaration, not a list here and not
# a parse of the registry row's prose: every `credential.rotate.*` rule
# under infra/dispatcher/rules/ carries `secret_namespace` / `secret_name`
# as handler args, and those args are exactly what the handler writes
# (credential_issuer.rs `write_key`). Reading them means the converge
# creates the Secret the broker will fill, by construction; a second
# copy on the registry row would be the pair §9a says drifts. The tree
# is the converging checkout, so no read of the system of record is
# needed to know what to create (an arm that needs the patient is not
# an arm).

#   spelling is `"\"boss\""`. A broker rule whose Secret is not a literal
