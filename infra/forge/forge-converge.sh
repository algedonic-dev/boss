# forge-converge — the forge host adopts its OWN units from forge main,
# the way cluster-deploy-runner rolls the CLUSTER onto forge main.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The cluster converges every ten minutes; the forge
# host had no equivalent loop for its own infra/forge + infra/ops
# units, so every unit authored after the last hand-run of install.sh
# sat inert on main: reap-dead-ci-jobs through the 2026-08-17 fill,
# disk-floor-sweep through the 2026-09-03 fill that blocked every
# train. "Landed but never installed" was a recurring, expensive class
# of defect, and its single cause was that nothing ran install.sh. This
# closes the class: main moves, the next converge installs whatever is
# new. (docs/design/the-build-plane-manages-itself.md, car 4 / keystone.)
#
# It runs install.sh, which is idempotent — installs+enables every unit
# in its UNITS list and restarts only what changed. forge-converge is
# itself in that list, so after the ONE bootstrap `sudo install.sh` it
# reinstalls itself and no unit ever again needs a hand-install.
#
# Install (forge host — the one surviving hand action, the bootstrap
# that installs the loop that ends the bootstraps):
#   sudo cp infra/forge/forge-converge.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now forge-converge.timer
# or simply `sudo infra/forge/install.sh`, which now covers it.

# pass, so the pass that cuts the checkout over already reads the file
# here; a pass with no file (the deposit refused, and said why on this
