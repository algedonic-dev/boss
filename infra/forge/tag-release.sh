#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tag-release.sh <version> <sha> <release-packet-id> — put an annotated
# tag on the forge at a LANDED train's merge commit, read it back, and
# answer on one line. MUTATING: it writes exactly one ref.
#
# WHY (backlog 05d301be, left by the cut-a-release tenant car on
# 2026-09-18). No ops verb writes a git ref on the forge — 31 verbs,
# none tags — so the tenant's cut-a-release protocol left its `tag`
# step to the founder by hand: fetch, `git tag -a`, `git push`, read
# the sha back, type it onto the step. David's rule (2026-09-16):
# "avoid doing anything by hand unless absolutely required" — a tag is
# a mechanical act on a fact the record already holds, so it is the
# machine's. This is that door, in the shape the allowlist demands
# (infra/ops/verbs/tag-release.json): three pattern-checked params, one
# fixed script, every bound a refusal that changes nothing.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES, each named on stdout with exit 1 and NOTHING written
# (the refusals run before the tag exists anywhere):
#   * a version not shaped vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, a sha shorter than 7
#     hex or not hex, a packet id that is not a full uuid — the
#     allowlist refuses these first (patterns in the verb file), and
#     the script does not rely on it;
#   * a tag of that name already on the forge (`git ls-remote --tags`):
#     a release is cut once, and a second push would be a silent no-op
#     or a moved tag, both worse than a refusal;
#   * a sha PREFIX that names no commit, or more than one, in the
#     converged checkout (`git rev-parse --verify <sha>^{commit}`; git's
#     own "is ambiguous" rides the refusal). The record holds a closed
#     train's merge_ref as the conductor's TWELVE chars, so the rule
#     that files this request (file-tag-release-on-release-tag-ready,
#     backlog 89c95245) can only hand over a prefix; resolving it here
#     is one rev-parse in the checkout the ancestry check already
#     reads. Every bound below, the tag, the read-back and the answer
#     line run on the FULL forty-hex id it resolves to;
#   * a sha that no CLOSED pr-train's `merged` step records as its
#     `merge_ref`, read off the system of record: the version names a
#     TRAIN THAT LANDED, never an arbitrary commit — `merge_ref` is the
#     conductor's 12-char prefix of the forge's merge oid
#     (train/conductor.rs), so the test is prefix-equality at >= 7
#     chars, the same `commits_match` the conductor applies. An open
#     train's is not proof; an EMPTY listing is a failed read, not a
#     fact (an unidentified reader is handed a smaller world, backlog
#     61085a9e), and refuses;
#   * a sha that is not an ancestor of the converged main — HEAD of the
#     converged checkout, which forge-converge.sh detaches at forge main
#     every ten minutes (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`).
#
# ON SUCCESS: `git tag -a <version> <sha>` in the converged checkout, as
# its OWNER (root's git in david's clone leaves root-owned objects the
# owner cannot collect — forge-converge.sh's rule), with a message that
# carries the version, the release packet id, the train and the
# ops-request; `git push <remote> refs/tags/<version>` as the same
# owner, whose login environment carries the forge credential helper
# (the converge's own arrangement — no token is read, held or printed
# here); then `git ls-remote --tags` READ BACK, and the peeled commit
# the forge now holds under that tag must be the sha given — a forge
# answer is not a forge effect. The LAST line is the answer:
#
#   tag-release: <version> at <sha> (packet <release-packet-id>)
#
# which the dispatcher rule complete-release-tag-on-tag-release-answered
# reads off the answered ops-request (jobs.complete_linked_step with a
# verdict_pattern) to complete the release packet's `tag` step with the
# tag and the sha COPIED from this read-back, never retyped. The rule
# follows `metadata.release` on the ops-request, which is the same id
# as the third argument: the filer writes both, the tag message keeps
# one, the rule reads the other.
#
# The GitHub half — the release on the public mirror, a tag on the
# snapshot whose tree equals the tagged tree — is a second verb, after
# David merges the mirror PR (backlog 05d301be names it). Not here.
