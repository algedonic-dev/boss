# prune-registry-versions — delete the forge registry's image versions

# record exactly what was kept, why, and what went.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (backlog 9789a827, David 2026-09-17: the disk was not
# delivered; 'that order sounds great' — buy the headroom)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Measured 2026-09-16: /opt/forgejo/data is 93 GB of the forge's 228 GB
# disk — the Forgejo container registry every train pushes a
# `boss:<sha>` image to (~1–3 GB each, plus `boss-ci:<sha>` per train)
# — and nothing prunes the REGISTRY side. prune-registry-tags.lib.sh
# removes LOCAL docker tags, and only after the registry holds them,
# because the registry IS the rollback path; disk-floor-sweep reaches
# ~76 GB free and stops; the locomotive floor flapped all day until it
# was set to 40. The replacement disk was not delivered, so the
# registry keeps growing ~2 GB per train. Forgejo's own package cleanup
# rules are a dashboard act; this verb is the machine's.
#
# WHAT THE REGISTRY HOLDS (measured 2026-09-17 against the live forge,
# Forgejo 16.0.2: 1,423 container versions). `docker push` of a tag
# stores THREE package versions: the tag (whose one file is the OCI
# index, manifest.json) and two untagged `sha256:<digest>` children —
# the image manifest and buildx's provenance manifest — and the
# CHILDREN are where the layer files live. Deleting only the tag frees
# nothing; deleting a child another tag shares breaks that tag. So the
# index of EVERY tagged version is read (through /v2, the docker pull
# path) before anything is classified, and a child goes only when
# every tag that references it goes. The packages API declares no
# sizes (`files[].size` is null), so bytes are not claimed here: the
# record carries `df` of the data directory before and after, and the
# blobs themselves are reclaimed by Forgejo's own cleanup cron once no
# version references them — the operator reads the difference on the
# packet, this script does not guess it. Measured on the first real
# prune (backlog ea67ad87, 2026-09-17): 1,337 deleted, df moved 724 KB
# — the cron had not run yet. Its cadence, [cron.cleanup_packages] in
# app.ini, is not in this tree; the record reads it off the forge's
# own app.ini at run time (`cleanup_cron`) or says it could not.
#
# THE KEEP SET, derived — never a list typed here — and a half that
# cannot be derived is a REFUSAL that deletes nothing:
#
#   1. THE LIVE IMAGES. Every image tag the cluster runs under the
#      registry's owner (`kubectl get deploy,sts,cronjob -A`, the same
#      kubectl resolution the census uses), and specifically the tag
#      deploy/boss in namespace boss serves — the cluster-watchdog's
#      own read. No deploy/boss image = refuse.
#   2. THE ROLLBACK TARGET. The last-converged stamp the deploy runner
#      writes and the watchdog rolls to BY NAME
#      (`$BOSS_FORGE_LAST_BUILT`, default the checkout owner's
#      ~/.boss-last-built — the runner runs as that user; this verb
#      runs as root under the ops runner with no HOME). Absent or not
#      a sha = refuse: "roll back" is a target, not a verb.
#   3. THE LANDED TRAINS. landed-train-shas.lib.sh, the one reader the
#      disk sweep already trusts, over the newest 2N pr-train packets
#      (N = keep_trains, default 10; 2N so that at least N landed
#      trains are covered unless more than half are still open, and
#      more is the safe direction). It prints nothing when it cannot
#      answer, and nothing = refuse.
#   4. `latest` — the quickstart tag and the chores' image, never a
#      build artifact of the converge (prune-registry-tags.lib.sh).
#   5. EVERYTHING NEWER THAN 24 h (BOSS_PRUNE_KEEP_HOURS): a push in
#      flight, a train not yet closed, a gate's hand build.
#   6. EVERYTHING IT CANNOT CLASSIFY: a tag that is not a sha
#      (`rust1.96`), a version whose created_at does not parse, a tag
#      whose index could not be read (its children are unknown), and —
#      while ANY index was unreadable — every untagged version no
#      readable index references. Unclassified is kept and named.
#
# THE CREDENTIAL. The converge pushes with david's rootless docker and
# its ambient registry login (cluster-deploy-runner.sh; mirror-base-
# images.sh points root at the same config). That login is
# `auths."<registry host>".auth` in the checkout owner's
# ~/.docker/config.json — base64 of user:token — and it is the one
# credential this verb uses, for the packages API (Basic, the token as
# the password) and for the /v2 manifest reads (a bearer minted from it
# at /v2/token, docker's own flow). IT IS NEVER PRINTED: it rides in a
# curl config file (mode 600, in a private tempdir), never in argv,
# and every line a tool says back is scrubbed of it before it reaches
# the packet. Measured 2026-09-17: the pod's read token answers the
# listing 403 for want of `read:package`, so the scope is measured here
# too — a 403 refuses NAMING THE SCOPE the forge's own message asks
# for (`read:package` on the listing, `write:package` on the first
# DELETE), a ceremony for David, and the real run stops on that first
# DELETE before a second attempt. Forgejo's package scopes are read and
# write; a delete is a write.
#
# USAGE
#   prune-registry-versions.sh --dry-run | --for-real [keep_trains]
#
# EXIT
#   0  done (or, with --dry-run, the keep set and the plan)
#   2  refused — the reason names the bound; nothing was deleted
#   1  failed part-way — the record states what was deleted; or a
#      tool this needs could not answer
#
# The record is ONE JSON line on stdout; every human-readable line is
# on stderr, so the ops runner's captured output carries both and a
# reader can jq the FIRST JSON line. The order is load-bearing (backlog
# 5323f3ef, measured 2026-09-17 05:27Z on the first dry run, ops-request
# 279b8659): the verb printed 1,313 per-version lines (165 KB) and the
# record LAST, the runner keeps the first 100 KB of a verb's output
# (ops-runner.sh, OPS_OUTPUT_CAP), and the packet held the plan's head
# and none of its verdict. So the summary and the record are printed
# BEFORE the per-version lines, in both modes, and the full list is
# also a file on the forge (BOSS_PRUNE_LIST_DIR/<stamp>.txt) the record
# names — written before the first DELETE, and a file that cannot be
# written is a refusal. A verb whose verdict is the last line must fit
# in the runner's window; this one no longer relies on that. And the
# per-version lines a REAL run prints carry the outcome as the verb
# (DELETED / GONE / FAILED <code> / KEPT), joined from the plan and the
# outcomes before printing; only --dry-run prints `would DELETE`
# (backlog ea67ad87: the first real run printed the plan file as-is
# and appended the outcomes after the runner's cut, so the packet read
# 898 conditionals under a verdict that said OK).
