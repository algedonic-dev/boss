# cluster-deploy-runner — converge the cluster onto forge main.
#
# The deployment half of the forge shipping protocol (directive
# 27ab7680): the conductor merges CI-green trains into forge main;
# this runner, on the forge host, notices main moved, builds the
# all-in-one image, pushes it to the forge registry, applies the
# tree's cluster manifests (infra/cluster/manifests/), and rolls the
# cluster deployment. Derived state reconverging on intent
# (deployment-as-network) — no ssh from the conductor, no shared
# credentials: each side touches only what it owns. Cluster config
# converges on forge main exactly like code does; hand-applied
# changes are drift (see infra/cluster/manifests/README.md).
#
# Install (forge host):
#   sudo cp infra/forge/cluster-deploy-runner.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now cluster-deploy-runner.timer
#
# Expects: a clone at $REPO with a `forgejo` remote; rootless docker
# (lingering enabled) logged into the registry; a kubeconfig at
# $KUBECONFIG_PATH; kubectl via the alpine/k8s container.

# Run from a SNAPSHOT, never from the file this script is about to

#
# This script lives inside $REPO, and a few lines below it runs
# `git checkout "$HEAD"` on that same repo. Bash does not read a script
# into memory; it reads incrementally and remembers a BYTE OFFSET. So
# when git replaces the file underneath a running invocation, bash
# carries on reading the new contents from the old offset — resuming
# mid-token, skipping a command, or executing a fragment of a line that
# happens to be syntactically valid. The failure is silent, unrepeatable
# and shaped by how much the diff moved the bytes, which makes it close
# to undiagnosable from the outcome alone.
#
# It has not bitten yet only because the file changed rarely and the
# offsets happened to survive. That is luck, not a property.
#
# `exec` into a copy makes the executing file structurally incapable of
# being rewritten: git can do whatever it likes to $REPO afterwards,
# because the bytes bash is reading are no longer reachable from there.
# The env var is the recursion guard and also carries the path so the
# snapshot can clean itself up on the way out — the trap belongs in the
# snapshot's own process, since `exec` replaces this one and would never

# and the record held the Dockerfile context dump, a one-line ERROR,
# and NOTHING the compiler said. Establishing even the exit code meant
# reading an untruncated journal line by hand; ruling out a compile
# error and a full disk took a workspace check on another box and a
# disk-report ops-request, and neither question should have needed
# asking. The build knew the answer and was told not to speak
# (backlog ddb0f7bd).
#
# `-q` suppresses OUTPUT, not work: it saves no build time, so the
# only thing it was buying was a quiet journal. Capturing to a file
# buys that too, and keeps the evidence. So the build always runs
# verbose into a log, the log is printed ONLY on failure, and the
# first failure is readable instead of the second.
#
# The stamp is the other half. The runner is stateless across timer
# firings, so without it a head that fails four times looks like four
# unrelated failures; with it the log says which attempt this is. It
# is deliberately NOT a quarantine — unlike FAILED_FILE, which holds
# an unbootable head out, a build that failed is retried, because the
# common causes here (a registry fetch losing a DNS race on this LAN,
# memory contention with a concurrent CI job) are transient and a
# retry that PASSES is itself the finding.

# `COPY --from=10.20.0.15:3000/david/…` and the manifests' images are
# forge tags the mirror list declares; the registry holding them is a
# separate fact, and on 2026-09-13 the gap cost two hours of unconverged

# tags resident, ~45 GB, on a 228 G disk that had reached 93% full —
# the host that also serves the forge, the OCI registry and the CI

# opening a packet about it for three days (`0e62f404`, `b99e9627`).
#
# AFTER THE PUSH, DELIBERATELY. The push is what makes a local copy
# redundant, so cleanup that ran before it could delete the only copy
# of something. `set -e` means a failed push never reaches this.
#
# The deletion loop itself — keep the N newest, VERIFY a candidate is
# present in the registry before rmi, never touch `latest` — is the
# SHARED definition in prune-registry-tags.lib.sh, sourced from the
# checked-out HEAD (we cd'd to $REPO above). disk-floor-sweep.sh runs
# the identical loop below the disk floor; two copies of a loop that
# deletes images is the drifting pair §9a bans, so the rationale for

# converge_tenant NAME NS TREPO TREF SITE — a repo-sourced instance's
# tenant: a fresh shallow checkout under $TENANTS_DIR/<name>, staged
# flat (tenant_stage) and applied as ConfigMap boss-tenant in NS from a
# client dry run, exactly as converge_step_plugins below applies the
# bundles. Nothing to do for an image-sourced instance. A checkout or
# stage that fails FAILS this stage: readability was measured first,
# so what is left is a defect, not a missing scope.
#
# THE SITE rides the same checkout (design b64c4377; backlog c8f6b233).
# When the instance declares a SITE hostname, the checkout's site/ is
# staged flat (site_stage) and applied as ConfigMap boss-site in NS —
# the directory the gateway serves under that hostname, mounted at
# BOSS_SITE_DIR. A checkout with no site/ yet applies an EMPTY
# ConfigMap (the site answers 404, the instance converges) and the
# packet says so: `site_source: <ns>: <site> (<n> files from
# <repo>@<ref>)` or `… (no site/ in <repo>@<ref> — nothing staged,
# the site answers 404)`. An instance without a site stages nothing
# and records nothing.
#
# THE CHECK BEFORE THE APPLY (backlog 1af5119d, 2026-09-19; the lib's
# tenant_check says why). The checkout is judged with `boss tenant
# check` before anything is staged, and only a PASS reaches the
# ConfigMap. A refusal — or a check that could not run — keeps the
# previous ConfigMap, records `tenant unchanged: …` on this packet as
# `tenant_check`, files a packet naming the file and line, and RETURNS
# 0: the software converges and the train arrives; the tenant did not
# change, and the record says so. The site rides on regardless — it is
# a directory the gateway serves, not one it boots from.

# (`instances_applied`), the fact the proof-in-prod probe reads.
# Deliberately AFTER prod's stamp and BEFORE the verification below:
# a playground apply that fails is a finding about the playground and
# fails this unit, but prod is already converged and stamped, so the
# next converge does not re-roll it; and the verification then reads
# every rendered object, both namespaces, in one pass. The ROLL of
# these instances is the last stage of the run, for the same reason
# in reverse — an instance whose Secrets are not minted yet waits
# 420s+300s for a rollout that cannot complete, and that wait must
# not delay prod's verification or the orphan sweep.
#
# AN INSTANCE WITHOUT ITS SECRETS IS SKIPPED, not failed (car cb784b3a,
# held on the dock 2026-09-16). The Secrets are minted out of tree, once
# per namespace, by David; as first built this loop applied the
# playground regardless and the roll below then waited 420 s + 300 s
# on pods that could not start — "Maintenance failed" on EVERY train
# until the ceremony, which is a scheduled alarm, not reliability. So
# the gate (cluster-deploy-lib.sh instance_secret_gate) asks first,
# deriving the required Secrets from the RENDERED manifests; an
# instance missing any is skipped whole, named on the packet as
# `instances_skipped: <ns> (secrets absent: a, b)` beside
# `instances_applied`, the `kubectl create secret` shapes are printed
# (names and keys, never values), and the converge exits 0. Once the
# Secrets exist the instance applies with no other change and the
# field flips from skipped to applied. A read the credential cannot
# make is neither — it fails this stage, after prod's stamp.
#
# AND PROVISIONING MINTS WHAT THE INSTANCE CAN MINT ITSELF, before the
# gate decides (backlog dc1bc724; David 2026-09-16: no hand work unless
# absolutely required — the playground was skipped on every converge
# from 2026-09-15 for want of six hand-minted Secrets, and only one of
# the six is a person's). The loop reads the absent set QUIETLY first
# (instance_secrets_absent — no verdict, no shapes for a person), and
# when anything is absent it applies the instance's Namespace — the
# Secrets must live somewhere — and hands the set to
# provision_instance_secrets (cluster-deploy-lib.sh, where each of the
# six is classified with its reason): internal ones minted from random
# bytes, shared ones copied from the namespace the instance list's
# `shares_with` resolves to (the sixth --instances column), the OIDC
# root created empty so the gateway boots guest-only, and anything else
# left for the gate to name. Values ride the `-i` kubectl's stdin —
# KAPPLY, the one that reads it — never argv, never this journal: the
# line below is names only, and it rides the packet as
# `instance_secrets_minted` the moment it is known. THEN the gate asks
# the cluster again, loud, and an instance that now has everything
# applies on this same converge.
#
# AND THE TENANT SOURCE IS MEASURED FIRST (backlog f4f5c387). Before
# the quiet read, before anything is minted for it, a repo-sourced
# instance's tenant is asked for with the converge's own credential
# (tenant_source_verdict above); one the credential cannot read is
# SKIPPED whole — `<ns> (tenant source unreadable: <repo>@<ref>)` in
# `instances_skipped`, `<ns>: unreadable (…)` in `tenant_source` — so
# the first converge after a flip names the missing scope. The tenant
# is DELIVERED after the loud gate and before the apply: the ConfigMap
# must exist when the pod first starts, or the launcher refuses the
# empty directory and the pod crash-loops until it arrives.

# THE TUNNEL INGRESS IS RE-RENDERED AFTER THE SECRET GATE, so a SKIPPED
# instance's hostname is served by the source instance until it is
# provisioned (backlog 40d46042, urgent). The committed
# cloudflared-config.yaml — dropped from prod's apply set above, so this
# stage is the object's only writer — routes every hostname to its own
# instance's gateway, and an instance the loop above skipped has
# NOTHING running in its namespace: measured 2026-09-16 07:4xZ, the
# rotation had moved playground.algedonic.dev to this tunnel as
# designed, and the hostname reached Cloudflare Access and then a dark
# namespace. The fix is
# sequencing, not a second file: the renderer is handed the SAME string
# the packet carries as `instances_skipped` — the idiom the manifests
# check below already reads, one definition — and routes a skipped
# instance's hostname to $SOURCE_NS's gateway under a comment naming
# why; with nothing skipped the render IS the committed file, byte for
# byte, so an instance that has just been applied flips back to its own
# gateway on this same converge. The map rides the packet as
# `tunnel_ingress` (`<hostname> → <namespace>[ (<ns> skipped: <reason>)]`),
# recorded by the `tunnel connector` stage below from the SAME skipped
# string — the one lib function both ticks record through (0b7804f3).
#
# THE CONNECTOR DOES NOT RE-READ A CHANGED CONFIGMAP. Read from
# cloudflared 2026.9.1's source, not assumed: `tunnel --config … run`
# parses its ingress once (cmd/cloudflared/tunnel/configuration.go
# prepareTunnelConfig → ParseIngressFromConfigAndCLI), and the only
# runtime update path is the orchestrator's UpdateConfig, fed by the
# edge for remotely-managed tunnels; the fsnotify config watcher
# (watcher/file.go) is wired only in cmd/cloudflared/main.go
# handleServiceMode — cloudflared started with no subcommand — and even
# there fires on fsnotify.Write alone, which a ConfigMap update (the
# kubelet's atomic symlink swap) never is. So the pods must roll to
# read a new render, and they roll EXACTLY when the render changed: the
# sha256 of the applied ConfigMap is patched into the Deployment's pod
# template as an annotation — the same value patches to "no change"
# and no pod moves, a new value is a rolling update (2 replicas, surge
# 1, unavailable 0, so the tunnel keeps a Ready connector throughout;
# the ConfigMap is applied BEFORE the patch, so the pods the roll
# creates mount this render). The annotation is a fact about which
# render the pods loaded, readable off the live object; `kubectl apply`
# of the committed cloudflared.yaml leaves it in place (three-way merge
# deletes only keys the last applied config carried). Recorded as
# `tunnel_ingress_render: <sha12> (connector
# rolled|unchanged)`. The connector is then READ, below, after this —
# so the `cloudflared` field is about the connector serving this
# render. A failed apply or patch fails this stage, after prod's stamp,
# exactly as a failed instance apply does: it is a write the credential
# could not make, not a Cloudflare-side fault.

# THE TUNNEL CONNECTOR, read after the roll and after its ingress is
# applied (backlog 5a2bb0ce; design 4c565f8c, David 2026-09-16).
# cloudflared.yaml is a prod pipeline manifest, applied above with the
# rest; its one Secret is created empty by the declared-secrets stage
# and filled by the broker's rotation, and prod's apply has no secret
# gate, so the pods either connect or wait with nothing on the packet
# saying which. cluster-deploy-lib.sh connector_status derives the
# Secret from the RENDERED manifest (still mounted at /manifests here —
# the apply directory is discarded right after), and records
# `connected`, `not-ready`, or `skipped (secret absent: <name>)` — the
# field the car's probe reads; when the ingress stage above rolled the
# pods, `connected` means the NEW pods hold an edge connection. The
# read never fails the converge: the tunnel is not what a train
# delivers, and a Cloudflare-side fault must not hold every train's
# packet red. Recorded through observe_connector — the one function
# the unchanged tick records the same fields through (0b7804f3) —
# beside the ingress map for the skipped string the apply loop decided,
# so the map describes the render the pods above were rolled onto.

# THE CONVERGE VERIFIES WHAT IT APPLIED (60690755). Everything above
# is a write; nothing above reads back whether the cluster now holds
# what the tree says. infra/cluster/check-manifests-applied.sh is that
# read — every named object present, and for the kinds where
# present-but-wrong is the realistic failure, contents matching — and
# it was running nowhere with a credential that could see the 41
# objects (the dev-session credential reports 39 unreadable). This is
# the one place with both the tree and the admin kubeconfig, so it
# runs here, AFTER the stamp: the deploy above is real either way, and
# a drift is a finding about it, not a reason to roll it back.
#
# A failure — drift (exit 1) or cannot-verify (exit 2, which is
# 'unknown', not 'clean') — fails this unit, so ExecStopPost closes
# the converge packet "Maintenance failed" with the exit status
# (timers-leave-a-packet): the alarm channel that already exists,
# carrying the check's own report in the journal. It does not retry on
# its own; the next converge — the next main move — re-applies and
# re-checks, which is the honest cadence for a drift.
#
# THE CHECK IS TOLD WHAT THE APPLY SKIPPED, and its verdict rides the
# packet (backlog 07d7549c; forge journal 2026-09-16 06:06Z). The
# first converge with the secret gate above skipped the playground —
# correctly — and then failed here: the check walked the rendered set
# and counted the skipped instance's 21 objects MISSING. And the packet
# said `result: exit-code` and nothing else; the cause was readable
# only in this journal. So the check gets the SAME string the packet
# carries as `instances_skipped` (one definition; it counts those
# instances' absent objects `skipped`, apart from `missing`), and its
# one-line summary is recorded as `manifests_check` whatever its exit —
# the field a reader off the host needs, and the one the packet lacked.

# AND THE OTHER DIRECTION. check-manifests-applied.sh asks "is every

# one an orphan answers correctly by being absent from it. The apply
# above does not prune, so the converge's own writes cannot close that

# here: this is the one place with both the tree and a credential that
# can read all 50 objects (the dev-session credential the lint usually
# runs under reports 9 of 16 pairs unreadable), so it is the only place
# the sweep means anything.
#
# It FAILS the unit like the check above, for the reason CLAUDE.md gives
# under "a check nobody reads is a check that is not running": a finding
# demoted to a printed warning in a passing converge is a finding nobody
# reads. An undeclared object in a managed namespace is a real finding
# and the message says the three things it can be.
#
# FIRST ADMIN-REACH RUN. Its exemption set was populated from the dev
# pod's partial view, so this may be the first time anything has
# enumerated live ConfigMaps, Roles, RoleBindings, ServiceAccounts and
# PVCs in `boss`. If it names something nobody has looked at, that is
# the check working: declare it, delete it, or add it to EXEMPT with the
# reason — one car either way. The deploy is already stamped above, so a
