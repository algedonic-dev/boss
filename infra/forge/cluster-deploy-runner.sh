# cluster-deploy-runner — converge the cluster onto forge main.
#
# The deployment half of the forge shipping protocol (directive
# 27ab7680): the conductor merges CI-green trains into forge main;
# this runner, on the forge host, notices main moved, builds the
# all-in-one image, pushes it to the forge registry, applies the
# tree's cluster manifests (infra/cluster/manifests/), and rolls the
# cluster deployment. Derived state reconverging on intent
# (deployment-as-network) — no ssh from the conductor, no shared
# credentials: each side touches only what it owns. Cluster config
# converges on forge main exactly like code does; hand-applied
# changes are drift (see infra/cluster/manifests/README.md).
#
# Install (forge host):
#   sudo cp infra/forge/cluster-deploy-runner.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now cluster-deploy-runner.timer
#
# Expects: a clone at $REPO with a `forgejo` remote; rootless docker
# (lingering enabled) logged into the registry; a kubeconfig at
# $KUBECONFIG_PATH; kubectl via the alpine/k8s container.

#
# This script lives inside $REPO, and a few lines below it runs
# `git checkout "$HEAD"` on that same repo. Bash does not read a script
# into memory; it reads incrementally and remembers a BYTE OFFSET. So
# when git replaces the file underneath a running invocation, bash
# carries on reading the new contents from the old offset — resuming
# mid-token, skipping a command, or executing a fragment of a line that
# happens to be syntactically valid. The failure is silent, unrepeatable
# and shaped by how much the diff moved the bytes, which makes it close
# to undiagnosable from the outcome alone.
#
# It has not bitten yet only because the file changed rarely and the
# offsets happened to survive. That is luck, not a property.
#
# `exec` into a copy makes the executing file structurally incapable of
# being rewritten: git can do whatever it likes to $REPO afterwards,
# because the bytes bash is reading are no longer reachable from there.
# The env var is the recursion guard and also carries the path so the
# snapshot can clean itself up on the way out — the trap belongs in the
# snapshot's own process, since `exec` replaces this one and would never

# and the record held the Dockerfile context dump, a one-line ERROR,

# verbose into a log, the log is printed ONLY on failure, and the
# first failure is readable instead of the second.
#
# The stamp is the other half. The runner is stateless across timer
# firings, so without it a head that fails four times looks like four
# unrelated failures; with it the log says which attempt this is. It
# is deliberately NOT a quarantine — unlike FAILED_FILE, which holds
# an unbootable head out, a build that failed is retried, because the

# tags resident, ~45 GB, on a 228 G disk that had reached 93% full —
# the host that also serves the forge, the OCI registry and the CI
# runner, so image growth competes with the registry it feeds. The
# daily disk-headroom and stale-build-cache sweeps had each been
# opening a packet about it for three days (`0e62f404`, `b99e9627`).
#
# AFTER THE PUSH, DELIBERATELY. The push is what makes a local copy
# redundant, so cleanup that ran before it could delete the only copy
# of something. `set -e` means a failed push never reaches this.
#
# The deletion loop itself — keep the N newest, VERIFY a candidate is
# present in the registry before rmi, never touch `latest` — is the
# SHARED definition in prune-registry-tags.lib.sh, sourced from the
# checked-out HEAD (we cd'd to $REPO above). disk-floor-sweep.sh runs
# the identical loop below the disk floor; two copies of a loop that
# deletes images is the drifting pair §9a bans, so the rationale for
# why verification is load-bearing lives in the lib's header now.
