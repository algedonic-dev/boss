# tenant-census — the brewery's footprint in the production database,
# READ-ONLY, as one JSON document. The conformance-report shape: fixed
# queries, JSON on stdout, exit 4 = cannot answer (naming the query),
# never a smaller set that looks whole.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (backlog d07dcc2b, 2026-09-16)
# --------------------------------------------
# The cutover (ffc83387; David 2026-09-16 "Let's do it") evicts the
# brewery's reference data from prod and trims the simulated packets,
# and the eviction verb must REFUSE if any real packet references a row
# it would delete. Nothing could measure that: the footprint spans a
# dozen seed files and the projections 7,437 closed simulated packets
# left; the only readers are the APIs, which answer per-service and
# per-actor; the dev pod cannot exec into the cluster (RBAC); and a
# port-forward to the prod database is the trap the never-test-against-
# prod rule names. So the measurement is an ops verb on the forge,
# through the same kubectl + kubeconfig resolution the deploy runner and
# delete-orphan-object use (infra/cluster/undeclared-objects.sh
# --kubectl, resolved once), exec'ing psql inside the postgres
# container the manifest declares. The eviction verb (the next car)
# takes its bounds from THESE queries — one definition (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#
# WHAT IT ANSWERS — six sections, six reads
#   row_counts   (a) exact rows per table, every table in `public`
#   seed_owned   (b) rows the brewery seed owns per table, matched by
#                    the seed's OWN ids/codes read from the checkout's
#                    examples/brewery/{seeds,data}/* — never a typed
#                    list; `--seeds` prints exactly the sets used
#   partitions   (c) jobs and every table carrying a `partition` column,
#                    by partition; every table carrying a `job_id`
#                    column, by the partition of the job it names; every
#                    other table listed under `unknown` — never guessed
#   references   (d) REAL jobs/steps whose owner_id / subject_id /
#                    assignee_id / completed_by is a brewery seed row:
#                    counts AND the first 20 ids, so a refusal can name
#                    something
#   workflows    (e) the workflows table by owning_team, with open-job
#                    counts (all partitions, and real only)
#   log          (f) what marks a simulated EVENT (backlog e2604427,
#                    2026-09-16): audit_log rows by the payload's
#                    `_simulated` bool and by the newer `_partition`
#                    stamp, by kind prefix, and — for rows that name a
#                    job — the cross-tab of `_simulated` against the
#                    partition of THAT job; rows naming no job, by
#                    prefix; the same marker read from event_outbox
#                    and event_facts; and the measured `elapsed_ms`.
#                    Why it must be measured and not assumed: the bool
#                    resolved from the CLOCK MODE at publish time (each
#                    module's http.rs: "resolved by the publisher's
#                    clock"), while jobs.partition (508cc38c) is per
#                    packet — so under the sim clock a real packet's
#                    events may read `_simulated: true`. The answer
#                    decides whether the log-filtered rebuild that
#                    trims the simulated projections (design e652c7c6
#                    option 1) filters on the flag, on the job's
#                    partition, or repairs the flag first.
#
# READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. Every psql opens with
# `SET default_transaction_read_only = on` in its own -c, so the query
# that follows runs in a read-only transaction whatever it says; and
# every query here is a SELECT/WITH. crates/core/boss-testing/tests/
# tenant_census_sh.rs greps both and runs this file against a stub
# kubectl. Nothing here is ever run from the dev pod against the
# cluster: the operator files it (`boss ops forge tenant-census --wait`)
# and the answer lands on the ops-request packet.
#
# WHY sh + jq AND NOT python: directive 26d61c97 (observe-units.sh) —
# the forge's ops-runner is sh + jq. TOML has no jq, so each TOML seed's
# keys come out with awk (`[[table]]` header, then the first `key = "…"`
# line), and the test pins every set's count to an independent read of
# the same file.
#
# USAGE
#   tenant-census.sh            the census (needs kubectl or docker+kubeconfig)
#   tenant-census.sh --seeds    print the seed key sets as JSON and exit;
#                               no kubectl — the test seam, and what the
#                               eviction verb reads for its bounds
#
# EXIT
#   0  the document is on stdout, one line. The ops-runner captures
#      stdout AND stderr onto the packet (`> raw 2>&1`), so on the
#      ops-request the six progress lines precede it: the document is
#      the LAST line of `output` — `tail -1 | jq .`
#   4  cannot answer — stderr names the query and carries psql's words;
#      NOTHING on stdout
#   2  usage
#
# ENV
#   BOSS_CENSUS_TREE   the checkout whose seeds are the key sets (default:
#                      the repository this script lives in). The
#                      ops-runner passes no packet environment, so this
#                      is a test seam only.
#   BOSS_KUBECTL       see undeclared-objects.sh; resolved there, once.
#   KUBECONFIG         a credential that can exec in namespace boss.

# (f) What marks a simulated EVENT (backlog e2604427). ONE pass over
# audit_log (1.4M rows on 2026-09-16): every row is reduced to its cell
# — kind prefix, the `_simulated` bool, the `_partition` stamp, and the
# partition of the job it names — and counted; every cross-tab below
# is then an aggregate over those few hundred cells, never a second
# scan. The job reference is what the packet named: payload.job_id, or
# payload.id when the kind is jobs.job.* (a job's own events carry
# themselves as `id`, boss-jobs rebuild.rs). `_partition` is read
# beside `_simulated` because the rebuilder prefers it when present
# (boss-core partition.rs from_event_payload) — so the cross-tab shows
# both facts the replay would use. event_outbox and event_facts carry
# the same envelope: one grouped pass each, and the note beside each
# says how it relates to the log, so a count that differs is read as a
# lag, not a second opinion. Nothing here is a per-row subquery.
#
# The marker expression lives once, expanded into the (unquoted)
# heredoc: true / false / absent, and `other` for a value that is
# present but not a boolean (a JSON null, a string) — which the
