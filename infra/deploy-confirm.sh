# deploy-confirm.sh — the deploy dead-man switch (deployment-as-network
# Q4), run by boss-deploy-confirm.service off its timer.
#
# deploy-services.sh ACTIVATES a generation (symlink flip) and arms
# boss-deploy-confirm.timer; this script EVALUATES it. Two readings —
# the timer fires at +2m and +8m after the flip; the delayed second
# reading catches the silent-death class a start-time probe misses
# (a dispatcher that boots clean and dies minutes later):
#
#   reading 1 green  -> note it on the marker, keep waiting
#   reading 2 green  -> CONFIRMED: verdict recorded, marker cleared
#   any reading red  -> REVERT: `deploy-services.sh revert` flips
#                       current back to previous + restarts, the
#                       verdict is recorded, and this exits NONZERO so
#                       the failure is loud in the unit's status
#
# The health evaluation is `deploy-services.sh probe prod` — the same
# probe_one roster the deploy prints, so the confirm can never drift
# from the deploy list (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#
# No pending marker means nothing to evaluate (a boot-time firing, or
# a verdict already reached) — exit 0 quietly. Deliberately a separate
# unit, never in-process waiting inside the deployer: a dead-man that
# dies with the deployer reverts nothing.
