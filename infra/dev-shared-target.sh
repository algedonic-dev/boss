# dev-shared-target.sh — point every cargo build on this machine at ONE
# target directory, instead of one per worktree.
#
# WHY, measured on 2026-08-16/17. An agent creates a git worktree per
# task and each one grows its own `target/`. Four of them reached 49GB
# combined and took the laptop to 324MB free, which killed a full gate
# mid-run and produced a failure that had nothing to do with the code
# (packet 865992c1 is the gate's half of that; this is the disk's).
# The main checkout's `target/` reached 81GB on its own. There are 35
# worktrees on this machine today.
#
# WHAT IS ACTUALLY SHARED, measured rather than assumed. In a debug
# tree: `deps/` is 2.7G of 4.3G (63%) and holds 486 rlibs, of which
# **461 are third-party and 25 are ours** — 95% of the compiled
# artifacts come from one Cargo.lock and are byte-identical across
# worktrees. So the saving is roughly the deps fraction for every
# worktree after the first.
#
# WHAT IS NOT SHARED, and why this is not a 100% win: `incremental/`
# is 1.5G (35%) and is per-build state, not a cache two trees can
# meaningfully pool.
#
# THE REAL TRADEOFF, and the reason this is opt-in rather than a
# committed default. Cargo takes an EXCLUSIVE lock on a target
# directory for the duration of a build, so two gates running against
# a shared one serialize. On the night this was filed there were
# frequently two or three gates running at once and that concurrency
# was worth having. Space or parallelism; pick per machine, per day.
#
# WHY NOT `.cargo/config.toml` IN THE REPO: the setting needs an
# ABSOLUTE path (a relative one resolves per-worktree and shares
# nothing), and an absolute path is machine-specific, so committing it
# is wrong. It also must never reach CI, where each job gets a fresh
# volume and sharing means nothing. Both problems disappear if the
# setting lives in the user's own cargo config, which is what this
# writes.
#
# ESCAPE HATCH: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=... cargo …` on a single invocation
# overrides the config, so deliberately-parallel work does not need
# this turned off globally.
#
# Usage:
#   infra/dev-shared-target.sh --status   # what is in force right now
#   infra/dev-shared-target.sh --on       # share (default ~/.cargo/boss-target)
#   infra/dev-shared-target.sh --on DIR   # share, at DIR
#   infra/dev-shared-target.sh --off      # back to per-worktree target/
