#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Start a throwaway Postgres for the DB-backed half of the test suite,
# apply the schema, and print the environment the tests read.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `infra/gate.sh` runs `cargo test --all-features`,
# which includes every `#![cfg(feature = "postgres")]` test. On a dev
# box with no database those do not skip — they FAIL, with
# "Connection refused", one panic per test. The failure is
# indistinguishable at a glance from a real regression, so the habit it
# trains is to wave them off as "environmental". On 2026-08-13 that
# habit cost a red train: `station_event_kinds_are_registered` broke for
# a real reason (migration 120 added a fourth `jobs.station.*` kind and
# the roster assertion still expected three), was pushed anyway because
# the same four `job_edges_pg` cases had been failing on Connection
# refused all day, and CI found it seventeen minutes later. A red signal
# you have trained yourself to ignore is worse than no signal.
#
# There is a second, quieter trap this file is the answer to. Running
# `cargo test -p boss-jobs --test stations_pg` WITHOUT `--all-features`
# compiles the whole file away and reports "test result: ok. 0 passed" —
# which reads exactly like success. Always pass --all-features, as
# gate.sh does.
#
#   eval "$(infra/dev-postgres.sh)"      # start + schema + export
#   cargo test --all-features            # now actually covers them
#
# Prints only the export lines on stdout so it is eval-safe; progress
# goes to stderr.
