#!/usr/bin/env bash
# seed-tenant.sh — publish a tenant onto a running BOSS stack: `boss
# tenant publish <dir>` through the shared doors (classes, the chart,
# locations, business calendars, the company Subject, policy grants,
# people, agents, Workflows, sensors, posting rules, dispatcher rules),
# retried while the stack finishes binding (backlog ee7b62bb,
# 2026-09-16).
#
# Run by tenant-launch.sh's publish_tenant for EVERY tenant, first
# (backlog b644d727, 2026-09-17): a tenant with an engine — the
# brewery — has its engine script run after this one, for what only
# the engine seeds (accounts, vendors, opening balances) and the sim's
# reset-baseline stamp. This script stamps NO baseline — a real
# company's log is never trimmed back to "seeded day 0" — and needs no
# engine binary, only `boss`, which the image ships in /usr/local/bin
# with every other workspace binary.
#
# Idempotent + retry-safe: every door is insert-if-absent / upsert /
# 409-swallowed, so an attempt that failed on the first unreachable
# service resumes cleanly on the next. The budget (30 x 5 s) matches
# the brewery script's 150 s stack wait; a cold stack takes 30-90 s to
# bind. A REFUSED plan (the directory fails `boss tenant check`) stops
# at once — waiting cannot change a file — and the launcher's DEGRADED
# loop retries it on its own cadence.
#
# Output is CAPTURED and printed: on success as the receipt of what
# was published, on failure as the only description of why (the
# brewery script's lesson — `>/dev/null` threw away the reason and it
# had to be recovered by re-running prepare by hand).
