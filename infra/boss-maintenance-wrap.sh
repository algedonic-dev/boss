# kind exists (yesterday's run FAILED and nobody closed it), reuse it:
# today's successful run completing it is the recovery, and the pile
# staying at one open Job per chore keeps boss-step's single-open
# contract intact. Otherwise spawn today's Job.
#
# The visibility contract, stated once: the timer is the EXECUTOR,
# the Job is the VISIBILITY. Success (ExecStartPost → boss-step.sh)
# completes `run` and the outcome marker closes the Job; failure
# completes nothing and the Job stays OPEN — on the fleet, the
# canvas, and the stage numbers — until a successful run or a human
# closes it.
#
# Deliberately NOT the dispatcher's schedule runner: that fires on
# SIM-day boundaries, and at warp a daily rule fires every couple of
# wall-minutes. Maintenance is wall-clock work.

# configured refuses, loudly, and systemd records a failed unit — which
# is a state somebody notices, unlike a packet filed in the wrong
# database. Set BOSS_JOBS_URL explicitly; deploy-services.sh writes it
