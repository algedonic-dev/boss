# Called from the timer service's ExecStartPre. If an open Job of the
# kind exists (yesterday's run FAILED and nobody closed it), reuse it:
# today's successful run completing it is the recovery, and the pile
# staying at one open Job per chore keeps boss-step's single-open
# contract intact. Otherwise spawn today's Job.
#
# The visibility contract, stated once: the timer is the EXECUTOR,
# the Job is the VISIBILITY. ExecStopPost → boss-step.sh records the
# verdict from systemd's $SERVICE_RESULT: success completes `run` as
# `ok` and the packet closes "Maintenance completed"; a run that died
# completes it with how (exit-code, timeout, signal) and the packet
# closes "Maintenance failed". A Job still OPEN at `run` is therefore a
# run in progress or a host that rebooted mid-run — which is what the
# recovery above is for. (Until 2026-09-05 the completion sat on
# ExecStartPost, which systemd skips on failure, so a failed run left
# its packet open looking exactly like one in progress.)
#
# Deliberately NOT the dispatcher's schedule runner: that fires on
# SIM-day boundaries, and at warp a daily rule fires every couple of
# wall-minutes. Maintenance is wall-clock work.

# configured refuses, loudly, and systemd records a failed unit — which
