# declared in infra/deploy-services.sh plus the list of bespoke
# services tracked elsewhere in infra/. Exits non-zero on drift.

# Catches:
#   1. Units on disk that nothing in git installs (the boss-docs bug).
#   2. Services in infra/deploy-services.sh whose unit is disabled or
#      inactive (would die on next VM restart).
#   3. Bespoke services in infra/ whose unit is missing or inactive.
#
# Does NOT catch config-file drift — use `deploy-services.sh check`
# for that.

# Usage: ./infra/check-service-drift.sh
