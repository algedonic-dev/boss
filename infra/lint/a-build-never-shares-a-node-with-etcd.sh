# a-build-never-shares-a-node-with-etcd.sh — the placement rule the
# 2026-09-11 outage taught: nothing that BUILDS may share a node with
# anything that fsyncs for the cluster.
#
# WHY. Incident a398c4d3: cp-2 — a control-plane node, so an etcd member
# — went NotReady for 21 minutes and took w-1 with it (KubePrism routed
# w-1's kubelet to cp-2's apiserver). The mechanism was the disk: image
# layer extraction on a pod admission, on a DRAM-less PM991a that also
# held etcd's WAL, stalled etcd, containerd and the kubelet together
# (/proc/pressure/io full ≈ 6.7 h on that node; CPU full 0). The SoR's
# own roll was that admission — and the-sor-runs-on-control-plane pins
# it there on purpose. The pipeline's write sinks (a gate's ~74 GB
# workspace, the seed refresh, every dev-pod builder) were only ever
# PREFERRED onto the build node; nothing forbade them a control plane.
# Two rules, then, and this lint states the second half:
#   1. cluster-state workloads pin to control-plane nodes
#      (the-sor-runs-on-control-plane.sh — unchanged);
#   2. BUILD workloads are forbidden control-plane nodes: a REQUIRED
#      nodeAffinity term `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
#      DoesNotExist`, beside whatever preference they carry. A
#      preference is a hint the scheduler drops under pressure; the
#      outage is the day it would drop it.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS. Every manifest listed in BUILD_WORKLOADS carries the
# required term verbatim. A manifest that cannot carry it yet is EXEMPT
# with the reason and the car that owes it — never silently.
#
# Runs on every gate; needs nothing but the tree.
