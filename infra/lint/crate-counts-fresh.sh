#!/usr/bin/env bash
# crate-counts-fresh.sh — the crate roster is described in prose in two
# documents. Prose drifts. This is the equality test.
#
# Origin (David, 2026-08-14, feedback 36c96b16 on /it/kb): "Displayed
# stale architecture diagrams... Let's build a protocol to help us
# maintain this."
#
# The protocol is a lint, not a reminder. A doc that says "27 crates"
# beside a directory holding 29 is wrong in a way no reviewer notices
# and no test catches, because nothing executes prose. On 2026-08-14 all
# three tier counts were stale at once — core 27/29, modules 16/18,
# orchestrators 5/6 — and none of that was visible from reading either
# file, only from counting.
#
# CLAUDE.md §9a: a fact that lives twice gets an equality test. The
# tier counts live in docs/architecture-diagram.md and CLAUDE.md, and
# the truth is the directory listing. Collapsing is not available —
# these are sentences meant for humans, not a data structure — so this
# is the pin, and it names the offending number when it drifts.
#
# What this deliberately does NOT check: the crate and binary NAMES in
# those documents. `boss-jobs-api` is a BINARY produced by the
# `boss-jobs` crate, so a naive name diff reports a dozen false
# positives — it did, on the first draft of this lint. Counts are the
# part that is unambiguous, so counts are the part that is enforced.
#
# Usage: infra/lint/crate-counts-fresh.sh [--self-test]
# Exit:  0 clean / 1 a documented count disagrees with the tree
