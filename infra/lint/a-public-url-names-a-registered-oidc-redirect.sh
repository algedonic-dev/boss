# a-public-url-names-a-registered-oidc-redirect — BOSS_PUBLIC_URL may
# only name a hostname whose OIDC redirect the tree declares registered
# at the IdP.
#
# WHY THIS IS A CONFIG-CHANNEL CHECK AND NOT A TEST
# -------------------------------------------------
# The gateway builds its OIDC redirect_uri as
# `<BOSS_PUBLIC_URL>/api/auth/oidc/callback` (boss-gateway oidc.rs), and
# Kanidm refuses an authorization-code flow whose redirect_uri is not
# registered on the `boss` OAuth2 client. So the day BOSS_PUBLIC_URL
# flips to a hostname whose callback is not registered, every login
# breaks at the first redirect — and nothing in the gate can see it: the
# gate never talks to Kanidm, the pod cannot read Kanidm's admin API,
# and the manifest is applied by the converge, not built. The only thing
# that can hold the invariant is a shape lint reading the manifest
# against a DECLARED fact (backlog 198c5fe9: the flip to
# https://boss.algedonic.dev, whose redirect was registered on
# 2026-08-12 and recorded in infra/cluster/dns/access.toml with that
# provenance).
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED
# ----------------
# For every `BOSS_PUBLIC_URL` value in infra/cluster/manifests/*.yaml:
# its hostname has an `[[oidc_redirect]]` entry in
# infra/cluster/dns/access.toml with `registered = true`. An entry with
# `registered = false` is a refusal naming the manifest, the hostname
# and the fact; a hostname with no entry at all is a refusal too — an
# undeclared redirect is not a registered one. Correcting the fact is a
# read of the IdP (`kanidm system oauth2 get boss`), recorded in the
# declaration's `measured`, never an edit to make the lint pass.
#
# NON-VACUITY. No BOSS_PUBLIC_URL in any manifest, or no access.toml, is
# a lint that lost its subject and says so (exit 1), the way every lint
# here refuses to report clean on nothing.
