# emitted-kinds-are-declared — every domain-event kind emitted in
# crates/ must be declared in the event_kinds registry
# (infra/postgres/schema/*.sql). WHY this is a GATE lint and not a
# runtime warning:
#
# The audit-integrity checker (boss-audit-integrity-check, schema 108)
# already guards drift — but from the OTHER side, and too late. It
# scans the live `audit_log` and WARNS when it finds a kind no
# event_kinds row covers. Two failures ride on that being a runtime
# warning over live rows:
#   1. It only fires once a row of that kind has actually landed in
#      the production log. An emitted-but-never-yet-exercised kind is
#      invisible until the day someone triggers it in prod.
#   2. It is a WARNING inside an exit-0 run. `ledger.excise_rate_
#      schedule.upserted` rode inside passing nightly runs, unread,
#      for 8 days (fixed reactively, migration 202609022300); the
#      `credential.*` kinds needed a same-car declaration to avoid the
#      same fate (202609031830). CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis names this class:
#      "a real finding — an emitted-but-undeclared event kind — rode
#      inside a passing run for days, unread."
#
# This lint catches the same hole AT AUTHORSHIP, statically, before
# the code merges: it diffs the kinds emitted in source against the
# kinds declared in the schema and FAILS the gate naming any emitted
# kind no row covers. The fix a failure asks for is exactly the one
# the runtime checker asks for — add a row (or a family pattern) in a
# new migration.
#
# HONEST LIMIT — literal + const kinds only. A kind assembled at
# runtime (`format!("ledger.{}.upserted", x)`) cannot be read from the
# source text, and this lint does not try; it covers kinds that appear
# as a string literal at an emit call, or as a `pub const … = "…"`
# whose name is passed to one. This is the same limit the manual diff
# that seeded migration 202609022300 had. Every kind that has bitten
# so far was a literal or a const, which is why the literal cover is
# the one worth gating.
#
# Enforcement shape mirrors the other infra/lint/*.sh checks: derive
# both sets from their source of truth, exit 1 naming every offender.

# EMITTED: every domain-event kind passed to an audit-log emit
# primitive in a non-test crate path. The audit-log write path is the
# transactional outbox (`record_event_in_tx` / `record_ledger_event_
# in_tx`), fed by `EventStamp::event(kind, …)` and, in a few sites, a
# direct `Event::new("source", "kind", …)` assignment or a crate-local
# `record(&mut tx, stamp, kind, …)` wrapper. A kind argument is either
# a string literal or the NAME of a `pub const … : &str = "kind"` —
# both are resolved here.
#
# A kind constant is referenced by path (`crate::events::ACCOUNT_
# UPDATED`) from a DIFFERENT file than the one that defines it, so the
# const map is built ONCE across every crate file (phase 1) and the
# emit scan (phase 2) resolves against that global map.
#
# Deliberately EXCLUDED, because they are not audit-log writes:
#   - `#[cfg(test)] mod { … }` bodies (fixtures like "order.created")
#     and everything under a tests/ directory.
#   - `hub.publish(Event::new(…))` / the free `event()` telemetry fn in
#     boss-cybernetics — SSE/telemetry broadcasts that never reach the
#     outbox (e.g. `cybernetics.cost.recorded`). Matching only the
#     `let … = Event::new(` assignment form, never `publish(Event::new(`,
#     is what draws that line.
#   - fact kinds (`finance.*`) and dispatcher rule topics (`step.done`,
#     `steps.*.done`): these are not passed to the emit primitives.
#
# The whole file is slurped and inter-token whitespace flattened so a
# call split across lines (the common formatting) still matches.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 1: the global const map, `NAME<TAB>value`, kind-shaped values
# only. Written once and fed to the scan as awk's first input file.
