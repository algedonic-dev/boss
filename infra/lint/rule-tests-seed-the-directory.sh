# rule-tests-seed-the-directory — a test that reads `dispatcher_rules`
# through `load_active_rules` seeds `infra/dispatcher/rules/` first, in
# the same file, or it is named here and refused.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (backlog 488cadca). Since the one-file-per-rule
# collapse (41ba00cd) the authored directory is the registry's
# definition and the table is DERIVED from it by the dispatcher's boot
# step, `boss_dispatcher::rules::seed::seed_authored_rules`. A rule
# change is a `version` bump in its file and writes no migration
# (`no-migration-writes-a-dispatcher-rule.sh`), so a fresh TestDb holds
# only the LAST MIGRATED version of every rule. A pg-backed test that
# calls `load_active_rules` alone therefore passes against rows the tree
# no longer ships and says nothing about the files the dispatcher boots
# from. Measured 2026-09-14: feedback_obligation_rules.rs pinned
# `complete-feedback-branch-on-car-merged` at the migration's v3 while
# the file said v4 (a second route the test never saw); it was fixed by
# hand on #370, and rule_payload_contract.rs had the same shape. The
# shape is invisible until a rule file changes, which is exactly when the
# test is supposed to speak — so a mechanism, not a note.
#
# THE CHECKED PROPERTY. Every Rust file under a crate's `tests/`
# directory whose code mentions `load_active_rules` also mentions
# `seed_authored_rules`. Whole-line comments are not code: a docstring
# may describe the load without seeding anything. File granularity is
# the mechanism the packet asked for — the seeded shape lives in ONE
# helper (crates/core/boss-dispatcher/tests/common/mod.rs, which carries
# both names), and a test that goes through the helper mentions neither.
#
# THE SECOND CHECKED PROPERTY (backlog 94f150f9, 2026-09-14). No Rust
# file under a crate's `tests/` directory carries an INLINE COPY of an
# authored rule: a code line `name = "<x>"` (the TOML key, as it sits
# inside a raw-string fixture) where `infra/dispatcher/rules/<x>.toml`
# exists. A copy tests the copy: five selection tests carried one, and
# the day this was measured `spawn-car-on-sweep-remediated`'s copy
# declared no version while its file said 3 — the same shape
# backlog_item_advance_rule.rs had, whose v3 copy passed against a v4
# file until replaced. A test about one authored rule reads its file
# (`common::authored_rule`); a SYNTHETIC rule — a name with no file,
# which rules_reload_pg / rules_wait_pg / the authoring e2e write on
# purpose — is not a copy of anything and passes. Named by file:line.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE, stated rather than discovered: a
# `#[cfg(test)]` module under `src/` (none reads the table today — the
# runtime callers in http.rs and registry.rs are the boot path itself),
# and a file that seeds in one test function and loads unseeded in
# another. Either would be a new shape; widen the check when one appears.
#
# EXIT STATUS: 0 clean, 1 a test file is named (by either property). Reads the working tree
# with `find`, never git, so there is nothing here that can refuse
# (lib/git-answer.sh's exit 3 is for lints that ask git a question).

  A fresh TestDb holds the LAST MIGRATED version of every dispatcher

  — so a test that reads the table alone pins a row the tree no longer
  ships (backlog 488cadca; feedback_obligation_rules.rs pinned v3 while
  the file said v4). Load the registry the way the dispatcher boots:

    seed_authored_rules(&db.pool, boss_testing::dispatcher_rules_dir()) then load_active_rules

  A selection test that carries its own copy of a rule tests the copy:
  when the file changes (a when-clause, an arg, a version) the copy keeps
  passing against text the dispatcher no longer boots from (backlog
  94f150f9; spawn-car-on-sweep-remediated's copy was two versions
  behind). Read the file instead:

    mod common;
    let reg = common::authored_rule("<name>");

  (crates/core/boss-dispatcher/tests/common/mod.rs). A synthetic rule —
  a name with no file under infra/dispatcher/rules/ — is not a copy and
  is not what this refuses.
