# a-dead-letter-is-read-from-outside-the-jobs-api.sh — the cluster
# observer carries the dispatcher's dead-letter counters into its
# observation, read off the dispatcher's OWN surface, and losing that
# read costs the counters alone, visibly, never the observation.
#
# WHY (backlog 8834804a). feat/a-dead-letter-lands-on-its-packet made a
# budget-exhausted handler failure annotate the SUBJECT PACKET, which
# covers 28 of the 34 topics the dispatcher binds. Two cases it cannot
# serve: six topics carry no packet at all (the commerce/inventory/
# ledger facts and the two estate events), and a dead-letter whose
# annotation write ITSELF fails — which is precisely the case where the
# jobs API is what broke. In both, the only record was a WARN line with
# a pod's lifetime. The dispatcher now counts them on
# /api/dispatcher/readyz (dead_letters, dead_letters_unrecorded,
# last_unrecorded_dead_letter_unix) — a local read that owes nothing to
# the jobs API — and this observer carries that count to the record on
# the next firing the record answers. CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: a monitor
# needs a path to a reader that does not depend on what it watches.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, by RUNNING the observer rather than reading it (the
# extraction is a-cluster-node-reports-its-headroom's, byte for byte —
# inline shell nothing executes is untested shell):
#
#   1. the observation carries `dispatcher` with the three counters as
#      NUMBERS, read from GET <dispatcher door>/api/dispatcher/readyz,
#      and the reading is spoken on stdout;
#   2. a dispatcher that cannot be reached costs `dispatcher: null` plus
#      a `dispatcher_unread` that names WHY, with every node field
#      intact, the POST still made and exit 0 — the node observation is
#      the observer's first duty (the alarm's silence sweep rides it),
#      and `estate.compare` turns the null into an informational
#      `dispatcher_unread` so going blind stays distinguishable from
#      zero dead-letters;
#   3. a 200 from the WRONG surface (a body without the counters) is
#      UNREAD, never zero — the confident wrong answer CLAUDE.md §Doors
#      warns about, refused at the instrument;
#   4. the door the block reads is the one the tree declares: the
#      Service name and port come from boss-dispatcher-internal.yaml,
#      and the block's default must name them (§9a — a fact that lives
#      twice, pinned; the Service cannot be sourced into a CronJob).
