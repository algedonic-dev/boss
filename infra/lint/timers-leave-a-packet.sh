# Every installed timer must leave a Job behind.
#
# WHY. boss-maintenance-wrap.sh states the contract: "the timer is the
# EXECUTOR, the Job is the VISIBILITY." ExecStartPre opens or reuses a
# Job, ExecStartPost completes it, and a FAILED run completes nothing —
# so the Job stays open on the fleet view until a later run succeeds or
# a human closes it.
#
# Three of eleven timers were wired that way. Eight ran nightly with no
# packet, no findings, no event-log trace and nobody's queue, which
# means a silent failure in any of them was indistinguishable from a
# success. deploy-services.sh's own comment records that four of these
# units were "authored but never installed" and each was caught by
# hand; this is the same class one step later — installed, running, and
# unobservable.
#
# David, 2026-08-16: "Let's make sure we have a job to handle each" and
# "get as much maintenance and management into job protocols rather
# than floating around scripts or system timers elsewhere."
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, for every row of deploy-services.sh's TIMERS array:
#   1. the .service unit exists where the array says it does
#   2. it calls boss-maintenance-wrap.sh with a kind (opens the Job)
#   3. it calls boss-step.sh with the SAME kind (completes it)
#   4. that kind is a real Workflow in the platform bundle
#
# (3) and (4) are the ones worth having. A unit that opens a Job and
# never completes it leaves an open packet every run — worse than no
# packet, because the fleet view fills with false failures. And a kind
# that no Workflow defines makes the wrapper's spawn fail at 03:00,
# where nobody is reading.

# `BOSS_JOBS_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:7900`. On a box whose local instance
# is not the system of record, that default is a silent redirect:
# measured 2026-08-17, the backup / audit-integrity / ledger-replay
# timers had fired on schedule for weeks and left 7 packets EACH on
# boss-gcp's legacy instance and ZERO on the cluster SoR. Every check
# in this lint passed the whole time. The 2026-08-13 split-brain
# (incident c4b4a6b0) fixed the pipeline units by hand and missed
# these.

# So: the deploy that installs a timer must also write its
# BOSS_JOBS_URL, from the tree, where a reader can see it.
