# Every installed timer must leave a Job behind.
#
# WHY. boss-maintenance-wrap.sh states the contract: "the timer is the
# EXECUTOR, the Job is the VISIBILITY." ExecStartPre opens or reuses a
# Job and ExecStopPost records the verdict — boss-step.sh reads
# systemd's $SERVICE_RESULT, so a run that succeeded closes the packet
# "Maintenance completed" and a run that died closes it "Maintenance
# failed" with how it died. Until 2026-09-05 the completion sat on
# ExecStartPost, which systemd skips when ExecStart fails: a failed run
# recorded NOTHING, its packet stayed open looking like a run still in
# progress (disk-floor-sweep, 16:10, through two FLOOR UNMET runs) or
# was closed "ok" by the next run's recovery (forge-converge, 17:39,
# exit 1). Check 3b refuses that shape.
#
# Three of eleven timers were wired that way. Eight ran nightly with no
# packet, no findings, no event-log trace and nobody's queue, which
# means a silent failure in any of them was indistinguishable from a
# success. deploy-services.sh's own comment records that four of these
# units were "authored but never installed" and each was caught by
# hand; this is the same class one step later — installed, running, and
# unobservable.
#
# David, 2026-08-16: "Let's make sure we have a job to handle each" and
# "get as much maintenance and management into job protocols rather
# than floating around scripts or system timers elsewhere."
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, for every row of deploy-services.sh's TIMERS array:
#   1. the .service unit exists where the array says it does
#   2. it calls boss-maintenance-wrap.sh with a kind (opens the Job)
#   3. it calls boss-step.sh with the SAME kind (records the verdict)
#   3b. that call is on ExecStopPost, the one phase that runs on failure
#   4. that kind is a real Workflow in the platform bundle
#   7. a boss-gcp unit whose kind only the bundle defines pins the
#      system of record inline and opens its packet best-effort (`-`)
#   8. and every CLUSTER CRONJOB does (2)–(4) too, because that is where
#      the chores live since the 2026-09-04 cutover — the nightly backup
#      ran unrecorded for twenty days inside this lint's blind spot

#   9. its cadence is declared, with the same number, to the
#      cadence-silence sweep that notices when its packets stop
#      arriving (CLAUDE.md 9a — the interval lives twice)
#
# (9) is the one that closes the loop. Checks 1-7 all describe a unit;
# none of them can tell whether its packet ever ARRIVES, so a unit that
# is uninstalled, masked, or failing before ExecStart leaves this file
# green while filing nothing — 23 nights of it, measured (e109f57e).
#
# (3) and (4) are the ones worth having. A unit that opens a Job and
# never completes it leaves an open packet every run — worse than no
# packet, because the fleet view fills with false failures. And a kind
# that no Workflow defines makes the wrapper's spawn fail at 03:00,
# where nobody is reading.

# 7. A CHORE WHOSE KIND ONLY THE BUNDLE DEFINES FILES WHERE THE BUNDLE

#
# Measured 2026-09-08 on boss-gcp (backlog e109f57e). deploy-services'
# jobs-url.conf drop-in points every timer at the LOCAL instance
# (127.0.0.1:7900, "a chore reports to the instance whose data it
# maintains", 2026-08-19). That instance carries only the three kinds
# baked into registry.rs — the platform bundle was never seeded there
# and never will be (the-cluster-is-the-system retires it). So a
# boss-gcp timer whose kind exists ONLY in the bundle gets
# `400 unknown or inactive job kind` from its own ExecStartPre, and a
# hard ExecStartPre turns that into a run that never starts:
# boss-ml-inference-batch failed 23 nights in a row and the ML
# predictions went three weeks stale, while boss-conservation-
# invariants and boss-deploy-confirm (the deploy dead-man) did the
# same. The estate observers had already met this bug and pinned the
# system of record INLINE with env(1) on the Exec line, which outranks
# the drop-in (91ddebfb); this check makes that the rule.
#
# WHICH UNITS. Kinds the bundle defines minus the baked-in three,
# minus kinds a cluster CronJob already opens (a boss-gcp copy of
# those is the vestige the-cluster-is-the-system retires: pinning it
# to the SoR would file a second packet of a kind the cluster already
# runs, and the wrap's reuse-the-open-packet recovery would then
# "recover" the cluster's. Retirement is their fix, not a pin.)

# 9. AND A TIMER'S CADENCE MUST BE DECLARED WHERE THE SILENCE SWEEP
#    READS IT — with the same number.
#
# Checks 1-7 prove a timer opens and completes a packet of a real kind
# on the right instance. None of them can tell whether the packet ever
# ARRIVES: a unit that is uninstalled, masked, failing before ExecStart,
# or pointed at a host nobody converges leaves this whole file green
# while filing nothing. Measured 2026-09-08, both by a human looking:
# boss-ml-inference-batch had been dead 23 nights (e109f57e — check 7
# was written for the cause; this is the missing detector for the
# effect) and the five-minute estate-observe-units observer had been
# quiet four days (408c81f6).
#
# The detector is the `cadence-silence-sweep-daily` dispatcher rule
# (migration 202609082300): it compares each DECLARED cadence against
# the newest ACTUAL packet of that kind and files one alarm per silent
# kind. Its declarations ride its own rule row's args, which is registry
# data an operator can retune without a deploy — and which means the
# interval now lives twice, here and in the .timer file that executes
# the chore. CLAUDE.md §9a: a fact that lives twice gets an equality
# test, and this is it.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, for every rostered timer that has a SCHEDULE:
#   * its kind appears in the sweep's roster, and
#   * the declared minutes equal the LOOSEST rostered timer for that
#     kind (maintenance-estate-observe-host is opened by a 15-minute
#     forge timer AND a daily boss-gcp one; the SoR can only honestly
#     expect the daily).
# A timer whose schedule shape this cannot read FAILS rather than being
# skipped — the same fail-closed posture the sweep itself takes for a
# declaration it cannot parse. A timer with no schedule directive at
# all (boss-deploy-confirm is armed by `systemctl restart`, not by the
# clock) is not a cadence and is not checked. A DECLARED kind with no
# rostered timer is left alone: it may be a cluster CronJob or a
# dispatcher-driven kind, neither of which this file can see.
# The cadence roster is the args of ONE rule, and since 2026-09-09 each
# rule is its own file (infra/dispatcher/rules/README.md).
#
# THIS CHECK COVERS ONE OF THE ROSTER'S TWO SOURCES, and since
# 2026-09-10 it says so. The args above are the TIMER half. A daily
# dispatcher CLOCK RULE that spawns a chore packet is equally a declared
# cadence and has no timer file to pin against, so it was outside this
# check — and outside the sweep — by construction: eight such cadences
# existed, three families of them had been silent for nine to nineteen
# days, and the public mirror drifted 238 commits behind with nothing
# announcing it (backlog cf0f5e2d). That half is now DERIVED from the
# rule registry at runtime (`cadence_roster::clock_cadences`), so the
# cadence, the kind, the target and the dedup guard have exactly one
# definition — the rule row — and there is nothing here for bash to keep
# in sync. What can still go wrong is a new rule dropping out of that
# derivation silently, and the pin for that lives with the derivation:
# `boss-dispatcher-handlers/tests/the_silence_roster_covers_the_clock_rules.rs`
# fails CI naming the rule. Re-implementing "which rules declare a
# cadence" in bash would be the second definition §9a warns about, which
# is why it is deliberately not here.
