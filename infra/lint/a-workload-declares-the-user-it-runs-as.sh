# a-workload-declares-the-user-it-runs-as — a cluster workload states the
# uid it runs as, instead of inheriting it from an image nobody reads.
#
# WHY THIS IS A CONFIG-CHANNEL CHECK AND NOT A TEST
# -------------------------------------------------
# The gate never builds or applies these manifests, so a green pre-flight
# says nothing about them. That is the exact blindness that let the
# gate-runner's pod-security warning persist unnoticed through nine gate
# launches in one evening (backlog bb5a902e). The only thing that can
# hold a manifest invariant is a shape lint reading the manifest.
#
# WHAT WENT MISSING
# -----------------
# Surveyed 2026-09-11 (backlog 5234cda4): of the twenty manifests under
# infra/cluster/manifests/, eleven pod-bearing ones carried NO
# securityContext at all and boss.yaml carried only fsGroup. Most of them
# run the BOSS image, which is already uid 1500 — so for those the
# BEHAVIOUR was never wrong, only the DECLARATION was missing.
#
# An undeclared uid is not a cosmetic gap, because the cliff is
# cluster-wide rather than per-namespace: boss.yaml enforces the baseline
# profile on the boss namespace only, and restricted:latest is the Talos
# machine-config DEFAULT outside this repo. Tightening that default would
# hit every namespace at once — so these are not N independent small
# risks, they are one switch away from being one large one. A workload
# that states runAsNonRoot + runAsUser survives that switch; one that
# inherits its uid from an image is admitted or refused on a property no
# file in this tree records.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY THAT AND NOT MORE
# -------------------------------------------
# Per pod template, at pod level:   runAsNonRoot: true + runAsUser: <uid>
# Per container, at container level: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
#
# Those are the three that cost nothing to declare when they are already
# true. readOnlyRootFilesystem is deliberately NOT asserted: it is not
# part of the restricted profile and it WOULD change behaviour — the
# chores shell out to boss-generate-configs, which writes files. An
# assertion that changes behaviour belongs to a car that measured the
# behaviour, which is what the exemption list below is for.
#
# THE EXEMPTION LIST IS THE POINT
# -------------------------------
# A file is exempt only with a reason, and the reason is always the same
# kind of thing: the uid its data or its credentials require has not been
# MEASURED yet. boss-backup.yaml is the worked example — its ship-key is
# defaultMode 0400 and (its own comment, line 264) "only ever succeeded
# because it runs as root", so the moment anything hands that pod
# runAsNonRoot the offsite leg fails, and it fails as an SSH problem,
# which is the wrong place to look. Guessing there breaks the service
# rather than one check. Each exempt entry gets its own car with its own
# establishment work.
#
# An exemption for a file that no longer exists is worse than no
# exemption: it silently widens to nothing and hides the next gap. So a
# stale entry FAILS here, the same way the consist check fails on a
# roster that has drifted from its directory (CLAUDE.md §9a).

    "boss-dev.yaml	part (3) of 5234cda4, and it is worse than the hard set: the dev container needs SETGID/SETUID for the ssh door, so it can never reach drop-ALL — only baseline compliance. A car editing this file rolls the dev pod on converge and ends the live operator session, so it lands only at a David-timed restart (boss-dev-manifest-cars-restart-the-session)."
    "boss.yaml	holds THREE workloads with three different answers: the SoR postgres StatefulSet (the gate-runner car had to read /proc to establish postgres runs as 999), the nats StatefulSet, and the SoR app Deployment whose strategy is Recreate — so any roll of it is a full outage of :7900. Carries fsGroup: 1500 today, which is the volume half of the answer and not the user half. One car each, measured."
    "boss-backup.yaml	the documented trap: its ship-key is defaultMode 0400 and only ever succeeded because the pod runs as root, so runAsNonRoot breaks the offsite leg and reports it as an SSH failure. Also carries a postgres container and a google/cloud-sdk container, each with its own uid answer."
    "boss-tls.yaml	goacme/lego writes ACME account + certificate material, and alpine/k8s shells kubectl; neither uid has been measured."
    "boss-tls-front.yaml	caddy:2.8-alpine, whose data/config dir uid has not been measured."
    "boss-estate-observe.yaml	alpine/k8s, uid unmeasured — and a separate car is holding this file, so declaring it here would collide rather than land."
