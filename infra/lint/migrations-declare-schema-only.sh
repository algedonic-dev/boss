# migrations-declare-schema-only.sh — a migration newer than the cutover
# declares SCHEMA; a registry row lives in its platform bundle.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (backlog 393d3234, design 42277636, consolidation H4).
# MEASURED 2026-09-18 on origin/main 1a09f660: registry rows whose ONLY
# home was a migration — stations (7 files), step_plugins (7),
# cadence_rules (9), delivery_policy (2). A migration is the wrong home
# for a registry row: it runs once, so a fresh instance cannot
# re-declare the row without replaying history (the playground's fresh
# database inherited 31 example-tenant rule names that way the same day);
# nothing drift-checks it against the live row (protocol-drift compares
# only workflows); and every edit is a contended timestamped file.
# Dispatcher rules left that shape on 2026-09-11 (one file per rule
# under infra/dispatcher/rules/) and the Workflow bundle before them
# (infra/platform/workflows/, seeded insert-if-missing every start).
#
# THE RULE. Each registry in REGISTRY_TABLES has a bundle directory
# under infra/platform/ that the platform seed publishes at every start,
# insert-if-missing by (name, version). From the CUTOVER stamp on, a
# migration may not `INSERT INTO <that table>`: the row goes in the
# bundle, and a change to a live row is a version bump there. The
# historical inserts stay exactly as they are — migrations are
# append-only history (migrations-append-only.sh) — which is why the
# rule is dated rather than absolute. A file whose leading numeric
# prefix is NEWER than the cutover is checked; one older is history.
#
# THE STAMP is written ONCE, here, and it is the car's own write time
# (`date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`, the fourteen-digit prefix a migration
# carries — a-migration-prefix-is-fourteen-digits). It is not "today":
# a stamp re-derived at run time would move, and a rule that moves is
# not a ratchet. Cars 2–4 of the same packet append their table to
# REGISTRY_TABLES and leave the stamp alone; a table added later gets
# its own dated entry beside it if its history must be exempt.
#
# WHAT IS READ. Every tracked infra/postgres/schema/*.sql, its SQL with
# `--` comments removed (a comment may SAY "INSERT INTO stations" to
# tell the story; several do). `UPDATE stations` is not refused: an
# in-place column fill on a row the bundle declares is still a
# migration's business when the column is new (119 and 138 are the
# precedent), and the equality pin in boss-jobs holds the bundle equal
# to whatever the migrations produce.
#
# EXIT STATUS (house style, infra/lint/lib/git-answer.sh):
#   0  the tree was read and no post-cutover migration inserts a row
#   1  the tree was read and a violation was found — the author's to fix
#   3  the tree was never read — a fact about the MACHINE; never `clean`

FAIL — the migration(s) above are newer than the cutover ($CUTOVER) and
insert a registry row. Since 2026-09-18 (backlog 393d3234) a migration
declares SCHEMA only; a registry row lives in its platform bundle, which
the seed publishes insert-if-missing at every start:

  * stations — infra/platform/stations/<name>.toml, one file per station,
    every column the row has. boss-platform-workflow-seed finds the
    directory beside its --seed-path and publishes it by (name, version);
    a row that differs from the live active row of the same (name,
    version) is refused, and a version bump is the edit path.
  * step_plugins — infra/platform/step-plugins/<kind>.toml, one file per
    plugin, every column of the row; the JS it names stays at
    infra/step-plugins/<frontend_url>. Same seed, same sibling lookup,
    same refusal, same edit path.
  * cadence_rules — infra/platform/cadence/<name>.toml, one file per
    rule, every column of the row. Same seed, same sibling lookup, same
    refusal, same edit path. The table stays live-editable: a rule
    re-versioned live is reported as ahead of its file, never rewritten,
    and a rule the operator retired stays retired.
  * delivery_policy — infra/platform/delivery-policy/<name>.toml, one
    file per policy (there is one, train-conductor), every column of
    the row. Same seed, same sibling lookup, same refusal, same edit
    path. One row is the whole policy: a train pins the version it
    departed under, so a bump changes the NEXT boarding's rules only.

Leave the migration to its ALTERs and put the row in the bundle. The
historical inserts before the cutover are history and stay as they are.
