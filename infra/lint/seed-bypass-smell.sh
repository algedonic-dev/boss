# Seed bypass-smell lint — enforces the principle in
# `docs/design/seed-vs-emergent-state.md`: seed files set initial
# conditions only, never downstream artifacts that should emerge
# from a Job step.done.
#
# This lint scans every SQL file that reaches a database at bootstrap
# — the migrations under `infra/postgres/schema/` and any `.sql` under
# `examples/` — for `INSERT INTO <denylist>` statements. Hits are
# reported with file + line number + matched table; any hit returns a
# non-zero exit code. The protocol-derivation lives in
# `docs/design/correctness-protocol.md`.
#
# WHERE IT LOOKS, AND WHY THAT CHANGED (backlog cdf2d959, audit H2,
# 2026-09-18). From the playground bundles' retirement until then this
# lint globbed `examples/*/seeds/sql/*.sql`, a directory that no longer
# existed, printed "no seed sql files" and exited 0 on every gate — a
# check that scanned nothing and certified the claim anyway. The seeds
# are TOML and JSON now and reach the system through the API; the one
# place SQL still writes rows into every database at bootstrap is the
# migration set, which is exactly where a projection INSERT would land
# if one came back (01-registries.sql and 40-ledger.sql already seed
# reference rows that way — backlog 718ac982). So the migrations are the
# scan, examples/ stays in scope as the forward guard against a returned
# SQL seed, and a scan of zero files is refused (lib/scanned.sh).
#
# Existing files known to violate the principle are listed in
# the ALLOWLIST below as known stop-gaps. New files MUST pass
# without an allowlist entry, and every entry must name a file
# that exists (lib/allowlist.sh).
#
# Usage:
#   infra/lint/seed-bypass-smell.sh [--strict]
#
# In strict mode, the allowlist is ignored — useful when
# clearing a stop-gap to verify it's actually clean.

seed-bypass-smell: bypass detected.

The flagged seed files insert rows into projection tables that
should come from a Job step.done emitting a financial_fact (or
similar). Per docs/design/seed-vs-emergent-state.md, seeds set
initial conditions only. Fix: extend a Workflow so the simulator
produces this artifact, or accept the empty view until the
model catches up.

If this is a known stop-gap that's been deliberately accepted
for now, add it to the ALLOWLIST in this script with a comment naming
the packet that owns it.
