# Reject `TODO #N` / `TODO.md #N` numeric citations in code comments.
#
# These references used to point at a now-dead numbered TODO.md
# scheme; the current TODO.md is prose-structured under H2/H3
# headings, so the numbers in code don't resolve to anything stable.
# A comment that says "see TODO #46" is no more useful than one that
# names the actual concern in plain English — the latter survives
# refactors, the former rots.
#
# Allowed: GitHub issue refs in code comments (we explicitly don't
# block `#NNN` on its own, only the `TODO #NNN` form), Markdown
# headers in TODO.md itself (the regex below skips *.md).
#
# Usage: ./infra/lint/no-todo-citation.sh
# CI: run from .github/workflows or pre-commit hook.
