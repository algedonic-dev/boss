# Forbid chrono::Utc::now() outside the allowlist of crates that
# legitimately need wall-clock access. Matches `Utc::now` on a word
# boundary, so it catches the called forms `chrono::Utc::now()` /
# bare `Utc::now()` AND the function-reference form
# `unwrap_or_else(Utc::now)` — the latter leaks identically (it gets
# invoked with no args later) and previously slipped past a
# parens-requiring regex into a projection rebuilder.
#
# Why this exists: every other "now" in BOSS must route through
# `state.clock.now().await.now` so the receiving service stamps
# audit_log via clock-api (sim or wall depending on deploy mode).
# A stray Utc::now() in a handler stamps audit_log with wallclock
# regardless of clock-api mode — the silent-wallclock-leak class
# that surfaced 116k mis-stamped rows in regen 18 (closed by
# v1.0.5 #68). This lint keeps the leak class from recurring.

# fixed two production cases where the leak was inside a SQL
# *string* — boss-commerce's AR aging used PostgreSQL's
# CURRENT_DATE directly (wallclock at the DB layer), and the
# boss-ml declarative rules + plugins did the same. The audit
# found nine more sites of the same shape.
#
# This pass flags SQL `CURRENT_DATE` / `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` /
# `NOW()` inside Rust string literals where it's part of
# business-domain date arithmetic. Legitimate operational
# record-keeping (updated_at, created_at, deleted_at,
# closed_at, settled_at, expires_at lifecycle columns) is
# allowlisted on the line itself — these are wall-time
# concerns by design (when did the row get touched), not
# happened-on facts.
#
# Allowlist categories on the line:
# - `<col>_at = NOW()` for the operational lifecycle columns
# - `expires_at [<>=]* NOW()` for policy/auth expiry checks
# - `COALESCE($N, NOW()|CURRENT_DATE)` — caller-supplied wins,
#   wallclock is just the fallback at the API boundary
