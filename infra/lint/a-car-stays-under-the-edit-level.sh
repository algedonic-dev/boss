# a-car-stays-under-the-edit-level — the gate half of the hosting door
# (a479faf7; design 01c3cc3f "Tiers are one registry, read three
# ways", reader 3): a car whose diff against the trunk touches a path
# closer to the core than the instance's edit level admits is refused,
# naming the FIRST offending path, its tier and the level.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# David, 2026-09-18: "We should use crate tiers as safety levels for
# our hosted model. Confident users can allow IT department editing of
# all files. Otherwise they won't touch core, and maybe even a data
# only mode." The level is TENANT data — `[meta] edit_level` in the
# tenant manifest, a tier NAME from infra/platform/tiers.toml (`data`
# is data-only, `tenants` adds the tenant's own crate and site,
# `modules` the company layer, `core` everything) — and it is read at
# BOTH doors the design names with ONE predicate: `boss dispatch`
# refuses a packet that declares `metadata.paths` above the level
# before an agent spends, and this lint refuses what slipped past a
# hand-run, on the diff the gate is actually judging.
#
# THE ONE PREDICATE. boss_core::tiers::TierMap::first_above is the
# Rust half; `edit_level_first_above` in infra/lint/lib/tiers.sh is
# the shell half this lint calls, held equal to the Rust by
# crates/core/boss-testing/tests/tiers_sh.rs over a fixture of paths
# at every level. This file parses nothing about tiers itself.
#
# WHERE THE LEVEL COMES FROM. The instance, through the jobs API —
# `GET $BOSS_JOBS_URL/api/tenant/edit-level`, which answers the
# manifest's declared word off the file the launcher hands every
# service. Not the checkout: the product tree has no tenant.toml at
# its root, and the instance's tenant (the tenant repo) is in no
# checkout a gate sees. Not a hosting default: the reader takes the
# DECLARED word, and an instance that declares none (`null`) — every
# instance today — or has no level door at all (404, a server from
# before this car) enforces nothing, and says so. The hosted default
# (`data`) is written where a hosted tenant is made (`boss tenant init`
# scaffolds it), never assumed here, because assuming it would have
# refused every code car on the operator's own pipeline the converge
# after this landed (measured: the tenant repo's manifest declares no
# level, 2026-09-19).
#
# WHAT IS JUDGED. The paths this car lands: the branch's commits over
# the trunk (lib/trunk-ref.sh resolves it; BOSS_TRUNK_REF overrides)
# plus whatever is staged or dirty, so a builder's `--quick` before
# the commit sees the same verdict the gate will. Empty on the trunk
# by construction, which is why this is not a scanner
# (a_lint_that_scanned_nothing_is_red.rs lists it).
#
# EXITS. 0 every path admitted (or nothing enforced); 1 a crossing —
# a fact about the BRANCH, the author's to fix by narrowing the car or
# raising the level in the manifest; 3 (LINT_CANNOT_ANSWER) the level
# could not be read — the instance dark, an answer that is not JSON, a
# 5xx, a level the map does not know — or git could not answer. Never
# a verdict on a guess: the gate turns 3 into a refusal receipt, not a
# red, and `--quick` warns.
#
#   target: <url> (override with BOSS_JOBS_URL)   is printed on a skip
#   so the gate's warning names the instance it could not read.
