# steptype-bundle-ratchet — a StepType field bundle may loosen, never
# tighten (backlog cdc23602).
#
# THE ASYMMETRY THIS GUARDS
# -------------------------
# A completion contract lives in two places and only one is versioned.
# A Workflow spec is append-only: in-flight packets stay PINNED to the
# version they were admitted under, so editing it cannot disturb work
# already moving. The StepType bundle is the other half of the same
# contract — the completion validator checks the UNION of the kind
# bundle's fields and the step's own authored fields — and it is one
# global Arc<StepRegistry> built from seeds/step_types.toml at startup.
# No version column, no pinning, no convertibility check.
#
# So adding a `required` field to an existing kind retightens every
# in-flight step of that kind at the next restart: a step that was
# completable a minute ago now refuses, which is precisely the failure
# protocol_conversion exists to prevent, reached through a door that
# check cannot see (it compares two WorkflowSpecs; the bundle is in
# neither). How close it came, 2026-09-01: backlog-item v2 moved
# `design-review` from `task` to `answer-question` — the versioned
# path, correctly pinned. Achieving the same effect by adding
# `verdict` to the `task` bundle would have frozen every live task
# step in every protocol, and both edits look equally routine in a
# diff.
#
# THE CHECKED PROPERTY
# --------------------
# Against the merge-base with the trunk, for every step kind that
# already exists there:
#   - a field added to it must be `required = false` (new-optional is
#     the one always-safe bundle edit);
#   - an existing field may not move optional -> required;
#   - an existing field may not change `field_type` (a pipe-enum IS
#     the value contract — shrinking it tightens, and telling a safe
#     widening from a tightening needs judgment a lint should refuse
#     rather than guess);
#   - an existing field may not be REMOVED (the UNION validator stops
#     requiring it, other consumers — sim faker, surfaces — stop
#     seeing it; removal is a contract change that belongs behind the
#     versioned path, not a restart).
# A brand-new kind may declare anything: nothing in flight carries it.
# required -> optional stays legal — loosening strands nobody.
#
# The real fix, if bundle edits stop being rare, is versioning the
# bundle and pinning steps to it the way jobs pin workflow versions
# (cdc23602 option 2). This ratchet is option 1: a few mechanical
# lines that turn an invisible hazard into a refused commit.
