# layer-order-audit — the network layers must stack, not tangle.
#
# THE PRINCIPLE
# -------------
# BOSS is described as a stack of layers: BossMemory (the append-only
# log and the projections that are pure functions of it), BossNET (the
# substrate — packets, stations, routes, admission), BossProtocols
# (the operating model, carried as registry data), BossActors (the
# contract by which a human or agent attaches, proves capability,
# claims, escalates) and BossApps (thin lenses over all of it).
#
# The framing is only worth the words if it constrains something. Each
# name carries a prohibition:
#
#   BossMemory   must not depend on anything above it
#   BossNET      must not know what work MEANS
#   BossProtocols must not require a deploy to change
#   BossActors   is the attach contract, not where logic lives
#   BossApps     must stay thin
#
# This checks the two of those that are statically checkable from the
# repo: the dependency ORDER between layers, and two SHAPE rules that
# catch the layer confusions found by hand on 2026-08-13.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT
# ----------------
# This is not the tier check. `tier-import-audit.sh` answers "how
# domain-specific is this crate?" (core / modules / tenants) and is
# enforced across all 55 crates. Layer answers "which layer of the
# network is this?" and is defined only for the network machinery
# inside crates/core — about a third of that tier. The two axes are
# orthogonal and both are load-bearing; see
# docs/design/crates-and-layers.md.
#
# Crates with no layer are not violations. Most of core is shared
# services (calendar, search, docs, locations) or Subject kinds, and
# those ride ON the network rather than being part of it. An
# unclassified crate is simply not checked.
#
# SECTION A — dependency order
# ----------------------------
# A crate at layer N must not path-depend on a crate at a layer above
# N. When this was first run (2026-08-13) it was already clean: the
# layering had emerged without anyone enforcing it. Section A is
# therefore a ratchet against future drift, not a cleanup.
#
# SECTION B — layer shape, ratcheted
# ----------------------------------
# Section A works on Cargo.toml edges, so it is blind to a file in the
# WRONG CRATE — which is exactly how both known confusions look. The
# memory crate contains `claude_dispatcher.rs` (spawns `claude
# --print`, tracks per-agent concurrency and cost: an Actors concern)
# and `tail_http.rs` (an HTTP read surface: an Apps concern). Neither
# creates a backward package edge, so neither is visible to A.
#
# Section B checks two shapes inside memory-layer crates:
#   memory-no-executor — must not implement AgentDispatcher
#   memory-no-http-server — must not serve HTTP (axum routing)
#
# A ratchet, not a ban, following idempotence-ratchet and
# dispatcher-rules-ratchet: today's two known files are allow-listed
# with their reason, and the count must not grow. Fixing one means
# deleting its allow-list line.
#
# Usage: infra/lint/layer-order-audit.sh [--self-test]
# Exit:  0 clean / 1 violations or self-test failure

# --- the layer map ---------------------------------------------------------
# Rank order. A crate may depend downward and sideways, never upward.
#   0 foundation  primitives and thin client/type crates; no layer of
#                 their own, depended on by everything
#   1 memory      BossMemory — the log and its projections
#   2 net         BossNET — substrate: packets, stations, routes
#   3 protocols   BossProtocols — the operating model as data
#   4 actors      BossActors — the attach contract
#   5 apps        BossApps — thin lenses
#
# `boss-jobs` is deliberately marked `net` although it currently holds
# BOTH the substrate and the protocol registry (30k lines, the largest
# crate in the repo). Marking it at the lower of the two layers is the
# conservative choice: it keeps the check honest about what boss-jobs
# is allowed to depend ON, and it is the seam a future split follows.
