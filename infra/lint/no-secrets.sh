# no-secrets — the "secrets never live in the tree" rule, as a gate.
#
# infra/cluster/manifests/README.md states the policy: manifests
# reference their secrets by name only; the Secret objects are created
# out-of-band; Talos machine configs, kubeconfig, and talosconfig stay
# in the operator's out-of-tree home precisely because they embed
# cluster PKI. Until now that policy was care, not a mechanism — and a
# credential that reaches git history stays reachable in every clone
# long after the line is deleted. This lint promotes the care into a
# check, the way the locomotive check promoted environment caution
# into one.
#
# What it scans — every tracked file (git ls-files), line by line:
#
#   private-key        PEM private-key block headers (RSA/EC/OPENSSH/
#                      DSA/PGP)
#   kubeconfig-data    client-key-data / client-certificate-data
#                      markers carrying a base64 payload
#   talos-cert-bundle  crt / key YAML keys carrying long base64 — the
#                      Talos machine-config PKI shape
#   wireguard-key      a WireGuard PrivateKey assignment with a real
#                      base64 value
#   token-assignment   token/secret/password/api_key/access_key
#                      assigned a 32+-char opaque value — skipped when
#                      the line is an obvious placeholder (a shell/env
#                      interpolation, an <angle-bracket> stand-in, or
#                      marker words like example / changeme / dummy)
#   url-token          a 40-hex Forgejo/Gitea token embedded in a URL
#                      as basic-auth
#   gcp-sa-json        GCP service-account JSON markers
#
# False positives are expected in fixtures and seeds. They go in
# infra/lint/no-secrets-allow.txt as `path:pattern-id`, each with a
# comment saying why it is not a secret — and every suppression is
# printed on every run, so the allow-list is visible policy, not a
# silencer.
#
# Findings print the offending line with the match replaced by
# [REDACTED:<pattern-id>], truncated: a lint that screams about a
# secret must not itself copy the secret into a CI log.
#
# Following the actor-stamp / locomotive precedent of checks that
# prove themselves, every run starts with a self-test: one planted
# fixture per pattern in a temp dir, each asserted caught; a
# placeholder asserted skipped; an allow-listed fixture asserted
# suppressed (and counted); the planted material asserted absent from
# every line of output. `--self-test` runs just that and stops.
#
# Usage: infra/lint/no-secrets.sh [--self-test]
# Exit:  0 clean / 1 findings or self-test failure
