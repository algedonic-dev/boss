#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Every binary the forge workflow invokes must be one the image has.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Train 52's `web` job died on `bunx: command not
# found`. The Dockerfile carries a single line — `COPY --from=bun
# /usr/local/bin/bun /usr/local/bin/bun` — so the image has `bun` and
# not the `bunx` symlink that ships beside it. On a developer's Mac
# both exist, so the step passed every local check and then exited 127
# in the container, twenty minutes into a train.
#
# required-tools.txt already existed to answer exactly this question:
# "every binary the CI gate invokes, one per line", read by
# locomotive.sh so a missing tool is a red signal in seconds. But
# nothing connected the manifest to the WORKFLOW — the manifest listed
# what the image should carry, the workflow invoked whatever it liked,
# and the two drifted silently. That is CLAUDE.md §9a's fact living
# twice, and this is the equality test it asks for.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS. The leading executable of every `run:` line in
# .forgejo/workflows/ci.yml, after stripping leading VAR=value
# assignments, must appear in required-tools.txt or in the allowlist
# below. It deliberately does not try to parse the whole shell — a
# pipeline's later stages, subshells, and `$(...)` are out of scope.
# The first word is where this class of failure lands, because it is
# the thing act resolves before any of the script runs.
#
# The allowlist is coreutils and shell builtins present in any Debian
# base. Adding to it is a decision; adding to required-tools.txt is
# how you say "the image must carry this", and that file is stamped
# into the image by build.sh, so the pair cannot drift unnoticed.
