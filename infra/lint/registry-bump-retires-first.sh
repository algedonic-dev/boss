# registry-bump-retires-first — a versioned registry row is retired
# BEFORE its successor is inserted, never after.
#
# THE INCIDENT (twice in one night)
# ---------------------------------
# 2026-08-15. `130-watchlist-dismiss.sql` inserted `my-watchlist` v2 as
# `active` and retired v1 on the next line. Three hours later, after
# the class had been diagnosed and written into docs/invariants/,
# `133-dock-wip-limit.sql` did the identical thing to `loading-dock`
# and reddened a THIRTEEN-car train.
#
# `stations_one_active_per_name` — and its siblings on cadence_rules,
# workflows and step_plugins — are plain partial unique indexes:
#
#     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... ON stations (name) WHERE status = 'active'
#
# A plain unique index is enforced per STATEMENT, not deferred to
# commit. Same transaction is not the same statement. So the INSERT
# collides with the still-active v1 and the whole schema load dies.
#
# WHY IT IS EXPENSIVE OUT OF PROPORTION
# -------------------------------------
# The failure is in schema LOAD, so every DB-backed test in the
# workspace aborts before running, and the error names a uniqueness
# constraint rather than the migration that violated it. The author
# reads "duplicate key value violates unique constraint" against a
# table they may not have touched, in a crate they did not change.
#
# WHAT THIS CHECKS
# ----------------
# Shape, not intent: within one migration file, for each table that
# has a one-active-per-name partial index, an INSERT that writes
# status 'active' must be preceded in the file by an UPDATE ... SET
# status = 'retired' on the same table. Both orders are legal SQL and
# only one of them survives the index, which is exactly the kind of
# thing a human eye slides over and a grep does not.
