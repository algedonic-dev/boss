# consist: skip — psql + curl against a LIVE deployment; an invariant on the running system, not on a tree (it has its own systemd timer)
#
# Layer 3 of the Job-completeness validator — the PLATFORM's
# conservation-invariant sweep over a live BOSS database. Per
# `docs/design/correctness-protocol.md`, every conserved quantity
# should satisfy `in − out = stock`. This script evaluates the
# invariants that hold for EVERY tenant — they name platform tables
# and platform facts only, never a chart of accounts — and each query
# returns zero rows on success and at least one row on violation. Any
# non-zero result fails the sweep.
#
# WHO RUNS IT. The in-cluster chore
# infra/cluster/manifests/boss-conservation-invariants.yaml, hourly,
# on every instance against that instance's own database (DATABASE_URL
# from its Secret), filing a maintenance-conservation-invariants packet
# on that instance's system of record; and
# infra/postgres/validate-brewery-sim.sh after a regen. Until
# 2026-09-18 (consolidation H12, backlog 236529aa) it ran ONLY on
# boss-gcp against PGHOST=127.0.0.1 — the retired second stack's
# postgres, never the system of record — and 14 of its 22 invariants
# were the brewery's chart of accounts and brewing process written into
# a platform sweep. Those fourteen (G H I J K L M N O P Q R V W) now
# live where they mean something: examples/brewery/
# conservation-invariants.sh, which the same chore runs after this one
# when the tenant directory the image ships carries it.
#
# Invariants (extend as new conserved quantities show up — and a new
# one that names an account code or a tenant's table belongs in the
# tenant's sweep, not here):
#
#   A. Trial balance — every gl_journal_entry's lines sum to
#      zero (debits = credits). Already enforced by a DB
#      trigger, but the sweep catches a manual INSERT that
#      sneaks past.
#   B. Inventory non-negative — no `inventory_items.on_hand <
#      0`. The schema doesn't enforce this.
#   C. Closed jobs have closed_on — every job whose status is
#      `closed` must have a non-null closed_on.
#   D. Paid invoices have paid_on — same shape on the AR side.
#   E. Provenance — every financial_facts row whose
#      `source_table='steps'` must point to a real `steps.id`.
#      The `seed-vs-emergent-state.md` principle in action: any
#      orphan fact is a forged fact.
#   F. AP cover — every `vendor_invoices.status='paid'` row
#      must have a non-null paid_on.
#   X. Job subjects resolve in the subjects identity table —
#      the R1 acceptance invariant: every jobs.subject_id has an
#      identity row (write-through + rebuilder + uniform gate).
#   Y. Declared subject edges resolve — the R2 acceptance invariant:
#      every event field named in `subject_edges` resolves to a live
#      `subjects` row (the drift net behind the write-time triggers).
#   S. Balance-sheet endpoint A = L + E — the report's own
#      aggregation satisfies the accounting equation (HTTP
#      check against LEDGER_BASE, not SQL; JE-level balance is
#      invariant A). Not counted in the "invariants checked"
#      line, which counts the SQL invariants.
#
#   (T and U are reserved: the income-statement and cash-flow
#   endpoints' structural audits — the S pattern applied to the
#   sibling reports. Tracked in TODO.md.)
