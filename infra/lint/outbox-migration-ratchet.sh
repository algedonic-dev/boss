# outbox-migration-ratchet — the kind-classification guard for the
# transactional-audit-log migration (outbox phase 2).
#
# THE PRINCIPLE
# -------------
# A domain event is the rebuild source for state. If it publishes
# post-commit (`DomainPublisher::emit_*`), there is a crash window
# where the state commits and the event is lost — the swallowed-write
# class behind the 2026-07-13 replay-divergence incident. The fix is
# structural: writers record the event ON THE TRANSACTIONAL OUTBOX,
# inside the same transaction as the state
# (`boss_events::outbox::record_event_in_tx` via an `EventStamp`), and
# boss-event-relay delivers it to audit_log + NATS after commit.
#
# THE CHECKED PROPERTY
# --------------------
# The migration COMPLETED 2026-07-28 (the last PENDING row,
# boss-cybernetics, moved to the record-only EventRecorder path), so
# this is now a FLAT BAN: NO crate may call the post-commit publish
# APIs. Domain writes record via record_event_in_tx inside their
# transaction; row-less signals (cybernetics telemetry, the jobs
# post-materialization step.ready pass) record via the EventRecorder
# port / JobsRepository::record_events. A brand-new crate that starts
# publishing post-commit fails CI immediately.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS AN EMIT SITE
# ---------------------------
# A method call to any of the four DomainPublisher publish APIs
# (`.emit_at(` / `.emit_with_actor_at(` / `.emit_simulated_at(` /
# `.emit_with_actor_simulated_at(`) in a crate's src/ tree.
# `publisher.rs` (the API definition) and `tests/` are excluded.
# Comment-only mentions are excluded.
#
# Usage:  infra/lint/outbox-migration-ratchet.sh
# The CI hook lives in .github/workflows/ci.yml alongside the other lints.
