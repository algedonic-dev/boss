# migrations-append-only — an applied migration is history, including
# its prose.
#
# THE INCIDENT
# ------------
# 2026-08-13. A doc-reference flatten edited three lines of COMMENT in
# infra/postgres/schema/111-gateway-audit-events.sql. No SQL changed.
# It merged on train #21, deployed, and `boss-init` refused to start:
# migrate.sh hashes the whole file, so the recorded checksum
# (f7cf9c874953…) no longer matched what was on disk (18902fd80ceb…).
# The Deployment's strategy is `Recreate`, so the healthy pod had
# already been terminated. BOSS lost its own system of record — no
# packets, no stations, no audit trail — for an hour, over a comment.
#
# migrate.sh caught it correctly. It caught it at DEPLOY time, in
# production, after the merge. This check exists to catch the same
# thing at gate time, before it can be merged at all.
#
# WHY CI COULD NOT ALREADY SEE IT
# -------------------------------
# The suite applies migrations to a scratch database created per test.
# A scratch database has no history, so "this file changed after it
# was applied" is unreachable by construction: CI tests migration from
# empty, production applies them incrementally. This check needs
# neither — it asks git, not a database.
#
# THE CHECKED PROPERTY
# --------------------
# Against the merge-base with the trunk, no file under
# infra/postgres/schema/ may be MODIFIED or DELETED. New files may be
# added freely — that is how a schema change is supposed to arrive.
#
# manifest.txt was exempt while it existed, because adding a migration
# necessarily appended to it. It was REMOVED on 2026-08-14: the ordered
# list is now the directory itself, sorted by the NNN- prefix, so adding
# a migration touches no shared file and two cars carrying migrations no
# longer conflict. Its allow-list entry stays below as the record.
#
# THE ESCAPE HATCH
# ----------------
# A migration that is genuinely wrong and has NEVER been applied
# anywhere can be edited in place — but say so out loud, in a diff a
# reviewer sees, by adding the filename to ALLOW below with the reason
# and the date. Deleting the entry afterwards is not required; the
# entry IS the record that someone checked.
#
# Usage: infra/lint/migrations-append-only.sh [--self-test]
# Exit:  0 clean / 1 violations or self-test failure

# Resolve the trunk to compare against. In CI the PR branch is checked
# out with main available as a remote ref; on a dev box `main` is
# usually local. A missing trunk is a hard error, not a silent pass —
# a check that quietly skips is the under-covering gate this repo has
# already shipped twice.
# Order matters. The forge is the trunk every car actually merges
# into; `origin` on a dev box is the GitHub mirror, which is a
# periodic backup and was 24 commits stale the day this was written —
# comparing against it reports every already-merged migration as a
# fresh modification. In CI the checkout's `origin` IS the forge, so
# the first hit there is correct. BOSS_TRUNK_REF overrides for the
# case where neither name applies.
