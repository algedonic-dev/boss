# A migration written after 2026-09-08 carries a fourteen-digit UTC
# prefix (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-`), not a twelve-digit one.
#
# THE CONVENTION. `20260908234904-migration-prefixes-carry-seconds.sql`
# grew the stamp from minutes to seconds after two builders collided on
# `202609082130` (backlog bc7cac00) and stated the rule: take the stamp
# with `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` when you write the file. Nothing checked
# it. Six migrations since have been stamped to the minute anyway — by
# hand, from memory of the older convention — and by 2026-09-12 that
# had two costs, both measured:
#
#   - THE APPLY ORDER IS NOT THE CALENDAR. The order is a numeric sort
#     on the prefix (migrate.sh, boss-testing's build.rs), and any
#     twelve-digit stamp is smaller than every fourteen-digit one, so
#     `202609121800-…` (written 2026-09-12) applies BEFORE
#     `20260908234904-…` (written 2026-09-08). Harmless so far because
#     none of the six depended on a later seconds-stamped file; the day
#     one does, a fresh database applies them backwards.
#   - A DATE CUTOVER MISREAD IT. `no-migration-writes-a-dispatcher-rule`
#     compares prefixes against `20260911000000`; the minute-width
#     `202609122000-a-sweep-arrives-with-its-measurement.sql` read as
#     2.0e11 < 2.0e13 — "applied history" — and the INSERT that lint
#     exists to refuse gated green. It is fixed to compare at one width;
#     this lint removes the mixed width that made the compare wrong.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES. Any `infra/postgres/schema/*.sql` whose prefix is
# twelve digits and later than the seconds migration's own minute, and
# is not one of the six named below. Those six are applied history —
# checksum-guarded on every live database (the 2026-08-13 outage is
# what renaming an applied file does) — so they keep their names and
# this set is closed: adding to it is the wrong fix for a new file,
# which is renamed with a fresh `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.
#
# Usage:
#   infra/lint/a-migration-prefix-carries-seconds.sh
#   infra/lint/a-migration-prefix-carries-seconds.sh --tree DIR
#
# Exit 0 = clean, 1 = a minute-width prefix later than the convention.
