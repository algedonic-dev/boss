# no-tenant-vocabulary-above-its-tier — the sensor, with a ratchet, on
# tenant words leaking into the tiers above the tenant (backlog
# be39298f).
#
# THE PRINCIPLE
# -------------
# BOSS core is a generic state-machine toolkit; the brewery and the
# used-device shop are tenants instantiated on it, and CLAUDE.md §10
# says no tenant-specific assumption lives in core. Until 2026-09-16
# that rule was enforced only as a Cargo dependency audit
# (tier-import-audit.sh), which sees crate edges and nothing else. A
# grep for the brewery's own words outside the brewery found them in
# every tier above it — 362 files: kegs in core registries, excise in
# module ledgers, the brewery simulator in an orchestrator crate.
# David, the same day: development moves on without the brewery
# tenant, "because I am guessing we will need to clear out a lot of
# hardcoded brewery code still."
#
# Clearing it is one car per concentration. This is the instrument
# those cars are measured with, and the ratchet that stops the number
# rising between them.
#
# THE CHECKED PROPERTY
# --------------------
# For every tenant that declares `examples/<tenant>/VOCABULARY` — one
# term per line, the tenant's own words, `*` for a word-start prefix —
# count the case-insensitive occurrences of every term in each TIER
# (the roots below), over .rs .ts .svelte .toml .sql .sh .yaml, and
# compare each tier's count to infra/lint/tenant-vocabulary.baseline
# (one `<tier> <count>` line per tier). Then, per tier:
#
#   count > baseline  -> REFUSED, naming the files: the leak grew.
#   count = baseline  -> clean.
#   count < baseline  -> REFUSED, telling the author to lower that
#                        tier's line in the same car. The ratchet only
#                        goes down, and refusing a baseline ABOVE the
#                        count is what stops anyone raising it.
#
# The count is derived from the tree on every run; the baseline is the
# one fact that lives twice, and the equality above is its test
# (CLAUDE.md §9a). It was written from this lint's own measurement
# when it landed, not from the packet's approximate grep — this file
# is the definition.
#
# WHAT IS NOT COUNTED, and why
#   - the tenant's own homes: examples/<tenant>/ and
#     crates/tenants/<its engine>/ are not tiers above the tenant, and
#     neither is a root below;
#   - test FILES: any path under a /tests/ directory, *_test.rs,
#     *.test.*, *.spec.*. A `#[cfg(test)]` block inside a source file
#     IS counted — telling one apart needs a parser, and a lint that
#     guessed would count differently from the number an author sees.
#     Move a tenant-flavoured test into tests/ or into the tenant;
#   - docs, worktrees, node_modules, target/: none is under a root;
#   - a tenant's NAME used as a PATH or as an ID: `examples/<tenant>`
#     (so `examples/brewery/seeds/tenant.toml`, `/opt/boss/examples/
#     brewery/data`) and `tenant_id = "<tenant>"`. The product must be
#     able to say which tenant an instance runs, and that is not the
#     tenant's vocabulary leaking. Measured the day this lint was
#     written: the car rendering every instance from one manifest
#     (infra/cluster/instances.toml, `tenant = "examples/brewery/seeds/
#     tenant.toml"`) was clean on its own gate and red beside this one
#     on the assembled tree, for naming the playground's tenant path.
#     ONLY those two forms, for the names of tenants that declare a
#     VOCABULARY; the same name as a bare word, or as any other key's
#     value, still counts;
#   - a word inside a migration's DELETE statement (backlog b5f21e82,
#     2026-09-18): `DELETE FROM … ;` in a `.sql` file, from the line
#     the statement starts on to the line its `;` ends. The rows the
#     historical migrations inserted under the demo tenant's rule names
#     are the leak in every running database, and the one migration
#     that deletes them has to spell those names. Inside a DELETE a
#     word can only leave the product, never arrive — and every file
#     in infra/postgres/schema is applied history that cannot be
#     edited, so without this form that tier could never fall to zero
#     once the deleting migration landed. The same word in an INSERT
#     beside it, or in the comment above it, still counts.
#   - a DISCLAIMED PHRASE: a `!<phrase>` line in a VOCABULARY, matched
#     as a whole phrase, case-insensitively. A term can be right in
#     general and wrong for one common literal — `brew*` deliberately
#     reaches brewery, brewhouse and brewing, and also reaches
#     `brew install`, which is Homebrew. The tenant already made this
#     class of judgement in prose (its "deliberately NOT listed" block
#     names tap, batch, hop, grain, barrel, ale); a comment asking the
#     next author to make it again is not a mechanism (CLAUDE.md §9a),
#     so the phrase is declared beside the words it qualifies and is
#     subtracted with the same exact weighting as the forms above. A
#     phrase carrying no term of that VOCABULARY is refused: it would
#     exempt nothing while reading as though it covered something
#     (backlog e9423392).
#
# A wrong path answers 0 instead of erroring (CLAUDE.md §Doors), so a
# missing tier root, a missing VOCABULARY, a malformed term, and a
# baseline that names a tier this lint does not (or misses one it does)
# are all refusals, never a smaller count.
