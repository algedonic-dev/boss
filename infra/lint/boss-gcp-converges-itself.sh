#!/usr/bin/env bash
# boss-gcp-converges-itself.sh — drive the boss-gcp self-converge loop
# into a scratch directory and assert what it would do to the host.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-04 the conductor moved into the cluster
# (`feat/conductor-cutover`) and took the boss-gcp deploy hop with it.
# That hop — `sudo /opt/boss/infra/deploy-services.sh prod`, run by the
# train's `deployed` step — was the ONLY thing that installed systemd
# units on boss-gcp, and nothing replaced it. Measured 2026-09-10
# (backlog 408c81f6, and the landed fix 4ef79606 whose own summary says
# it changed nothing until someone deployed):
#
#   * maintenance-estate-observe-units — last packet 2026-09-04, the
#     cutover day, and that packet is still OPEN. A five-minute
#     observer.
#   * maintenance-conservation-invariants — last packet 2026-08-19,
#     while its timer fires hourly on the host.
#   * maintenance-ml-inference-batch — no packet has EVER been filed.
#
# Three urgent CADENCE SILENT alarms were auto-filed for exactly those.
# The forge host had the identical disease and `forge-converge` closed
# it; `boss-gcp-converge` is the same shape for this host, and this is
# the same lint one host over (infra/lint/forge-install-covers-the-ops-
# runner.sh is the sibling, and its idioms are reused verbatim).
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   1. the converge script + unit pair exist, and the script is runnable
#   2. `boss-gcp-converge` is a roles.toml row — the loop that does the
#      installing is installed BY the thing it runs, so after the one
#      bootstrap no unit on this host ever needs a hand again
#   3. `install-units.sh units` installs every roles.toml unit pair into
#      a scratch root with a stub systemctl, enables every timer, reloads
#      — and stages no binary, converges no schema, restarts nothing.
#      (The installer was the `units` mode of the bare-metal
#      deploy-services.sh until 2026-09-18, when that path was deleted,
#      e109bd71; its rows were a TIMERS array pinned equal to roles.toml
#      by this lint, and roles.toml is now the one roster.)
#   4. the loop converges from the FORGE, never from the GitHub mirror
#   5. a dirty checkout is refused with the tree untouched
#   6. a clean checkout fast-forwards to forge main and drives the
#      installer's `units` mode — the existing installer, not a second
#      deployment mechanism
#   7. a failed install prints the installer's COMPLETE captured output
#      and exits non-zero (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: a record that says THAT
#      it failed and not WHAT is the defect class that cost a day)
#   8. the converge brings up this host's JOURNAL READ DOOR
#      (systemd-journal-gatewayd on :19531) and stays non-fatal when the
#      distro package behind it is absent — backlog 68757702: boss-gcp
#      had no read path for logs OR unit state, so a timer there could
#      only be diagnosed by a human on the box, and the forge's door was
#      hand-installed and therefore one rebuild from gone
#   9. the converge installs this host's ops-request RUNNER — the third
#      loop (act), after converge and observe — from the same one
#      definition the forge installer uses, with this host's identity,
#      this checkout, and the CLUSTER as its system of record. Never
#      127.0.0.1, which here is the legacy second stack: a runner
#      pointed there answers nothing and looks healthy (c3d06016)
#  10. the run SAYS WHAT IT INSTALLED on its own packet — counts, each
#      sub-installer's verdict, every skip named verbatim, the sha and the
#      remote, and the installer's exit status when it fails; and a
#      summary from an earlier run is cleared before this one can refuse
#      anything, so a stale record can never read as this run's. Measured
#      2026-09-11: `result=ok` was the whole record, and answering "did it
#      install?" took an ops-request plus 200 journal lines off the host

# unit state. `http://10.99.0.1:19531/machine` did not answer while the
# forge's returned 200, so the only way to read a unit's journal on the
# WireGuard bastion was a human with ssh — and on 2026-09-10 that cost a
# WRONG conclusion about a nightly timer, reasoned from the tree because
# the host could not be read.
#
# The forge's door was hand-enabled on 2026-09-03 and in the tree
# nowhere, which is the class forge-converge closed: one rebuild away
# from losing the one door that still works when the API is dark. So

# how (infra/journal-door-ensure.sh) is shared with the forge installer
# rather than copied beside it (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#
# WIDER THAN "UNIT FILES ONLY", DELIBERATELY AND BOUNDEDLY. The units
# mode's restraint is about BOSS's own fleet: no build, no schema, no
# service of the second (older) stack bounced. Enabling a distro socket
# unit — and, once, installing the distro package that provides it —

# against `host: boss-gcp` sat at `ready` with nothing behind it and
# every operational read on the WireGuard bastion went back through a
# human. It rides this mode, from the same ONE definition the forge
# installer uses (infra/ops/install-ops-runner.sh).
#
# THE FAILURE THIS SECTION EXISTS FOR is the invisible one. boss-gcp's
# `127.0.0.1:7900` was the legacy second stack (retired 2026-09-15), not
# the system of record. A runner pointed there finds no ops-request
# packets, exits 0 every minute and looks healthy forever: a wrong

# 10. THE PACKET SAYS WHAT IT INSTALLED.
#
# WHY, measured 2026-09-11. Car e09e30bd landed the ops-runner block
# above at 15:40 UTC; the converges at 15:52 and 16:22 both closed their
# packet `result=ok` and that is ALL either packet held. Asking the only
# question that mattered next — did it actually install? — took filing
# an ops-request, reading 200 journal lines off the host and parsing
# them by hand, and in the meantime the estate unit observer (whose
# roster is roles.toml, which this unit deliberately is not in)
# was read as saying the unit was absent. It was not absent. A reader
# with no host access could not tell "installed 14 pairs" from
# "installed 12 and skipped 2", so the wrong conclusion was available
# and got drawn.
#
# A single boolean IS the defect (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: a verdict must
# name what failed; a record reduced before it is stored throws away the
# only copy). So the run leaves a structured summary — counts, each
# sub-installer's own verdict, and every anomaly VERBATIM — which
# boss-step.sh merges onto the `run` step. The full log stays in the
# journal; the packet carries the counted shape and the anomalies.
#
# A SKIP IS LOUD, NOT FATAL: a roles.toml row whose unit files this commit
# does not carry is a legitimate state (observe-units.sh derives its
# roster by skipping exactly those), and failing the converge over one
# would stop the other thirteen pairs converging. It must be IN THE
# RECORD, with the name, which is what this asserts.
