# no-session-paths.sh — tracked source must not name an agent session's
# filesystem.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Two mocked playwright specs shipped with screenshot
# paths under /Users/david/.claude/jobs/<id>/tmp/ — an agent session's
# scratch directory, committed as if it were a place. They stayed green
# on the forge CI because the boss-ci container runs as root and
# mkdir -p'd the absolute path INSIDE the container; GitHub's
# unprivileged runner refused, and PR #231's web check was the first
# thing anywhere to say so (2026-08-20). An environment that can
# silently absorb a wrong path is exactly why a lint has to hold the
# line instead.
#
# Scope: apps/ crates/ infra/ — code and infra, where a machine-local
# path is always a bug. docs/ is exempt on purpose: session reports and
# runbooks legitimately NAME such paths when telling their story.

# --line-number over tracked files only; the pattern catches macOS
# home paths and agent scratch dirs in one pass.
# The scan body is shared (lib/pattern-scan.sh): it excludes this file
# and any test that must name the pattern to prove the rule. The docs/
# exemption below is this lint's own judgement and stays visible here —
# runbooks legitimately TELL the story of a machine-local path.
