# 4d5f158a: "The forge is operated from memory." Its units, containers
# and remediation live in one place — infra/forge/OPERATIONS.md — and
# the failure mode is drift: install.sh grows a unit, OPERATIONS.md does
# not, and the runbook silently stops describing the host. That is the
# manifest.txt lesson (CLAUDE.md §9a) applied to prose: two lists of the
# same fact (install.sh's UNITS array + the runbook's unit table) that
# nothing keeps in step.
#
# This does not add a THIRD copy — it PINS the two that exist. install.sh
# is the authority on what is installed (its UNITS array + the
# boss-ops-runner it installs via a drop-in); the runbook's "The BOSS
# units" table must name every one. A unit installed but undocumented
# fails this loudly, so the runbook cannot fall behind the host.
