# no-personal-address-in-infra.sh — an e-mail address under infra/ is a
# declaration about who may do what to the estate, and infra/ is
# published to the public mirror; a person's private address is neither.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-18, backlog 67e754cc). The publish-to-github
# review of packet b831512f read the 31 files that would become public
# for the first time and found, in infra/cluster/dns/access.toml, the
# playground's onboarding policy declaring four individuals by PERSONAL
# address — David's own gmail and three third parties admitted as
# visitors on 4/25/2026. infra/lint/no-secrets.sh was right that they
# are not credentials, so the tree read "clean" all the way to the one
# step a person reads, and the publish stopped at sign-off on that
# finding. The declaration now says `include.unmanaged = true` (the
# members are the dashboard's); this lint is what stops the next one at
# pre-flight instead of at the mirror's door.
#
# THE RULE. Every address in a tracked file under infra/ belongs to
#   * the company — `algedonic.dev` or a subdomain of it — or
#   * a RESERVED domain that names nobody: example.com/net/org, any
#     `.example`, `.invalid`, `.test`, `.local`, `.localhost`, or
#   * GitHub's per-account no-reply (`users.noreply.github.com`), which
#     is a commit identity, not a mailbox, or
#   * any `noreply@` / `no-reply@` / `no_reply@` local part: a mailbox
#     nobody reads is a machine's, not a person's. The commit trailer
#     every car carries (`Co-Authored-By: … <noreply@anthropic.com>`)
#     reached infra/ as a platform document on 2026-09-18 and the train
#     gate for #461 refused the assembled tree on it, the day this lint
#     landed.
# A systemd instance name (`wg-quick@wg0.service`) has the shape of an
# address and is not one; unit suffixes are excluded.
#
# THE FINDING names the file, the line and the address's DOMAIN — never
# the local part. A lint that prints the address has copied it into the
# gate log, which is the thing it exists to prevent.
#
# Files outside infra/ are not read: fixtures, seeds and docs carry
# made-up people on purpose, and a tenant's own people live in its
# repository, not this one.
#
# EXIT STATUS (house style, infra/lint/lib/git-answer.sh):
#   0  no personal address under infra/
#   1  one or more — file:line and domain, the author's to fix
#   3  the tree could not be listed — a fact about the MACHINE; never
#      `clean`

FAIL — the line(s) above name a person by a private address in a file
the public mirror publishes (found first by the publish-to-github
review, 2026-09-18, backlog 67e754cc). An Access policy that admits
individuals declares `include.unmanaged = true` and keeps its members
in the dashboard (infra/cluster/dns/access.toml); a company mailbox is
<name>@algedonic.dev; a fixture uses a reserved domain (example.com,
.invalid, .test). The domain is printed, the address is not.
