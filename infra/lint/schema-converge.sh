# schema-converge — every deploy path applies the tree's schema.
#
# THE PRINCIPLE
# -------------
# Code, config and schema converge from the tree on every deploy. Two of
# the three had mechanisms: images roll from forge main, manifests are
# `kubectl apply`-ed from the tree on every converge. Schema did not. The
# cluster's init container applied the manifest only to an EMPTY database
# — "Database already initialized (schema present). Nothing to do." — and
# nothing else in the deploy path touched an existing one.
#
# On 2026-08-13 that let FOUR migrations (112, 113, 114, 116) accumulate
# unapplied while every other layer rolled forward. Train #10 shipped the
# station registry, the image rolled, the code went live, and
# `GET /api/stations` answered 500 `relation "stations" does not exist`
# off a deploy that reported success. It was contained only because the
# missing tables backed new endpoints; an ALTER on a live table, or a
# boot-time schema check, makes the same gap a total outage.
#
# THE CHECKED PROPERTY
# --------------------
# 1. Every deploy entry point below invokes the migration runner.
# 2. In the init container, the converge is not skippable: no `exit`
#    precedes it, so no "already initialized" shortcut can grow back.
#
# This is the CLAUDE.md §9a rule applied to a property rather than a
# constant — it lives in three files that cannot be collapsed into one,
# so it gets a test that names the file when it drifts.
