# no-step-kind-match — no core code may match on a step-kind name
# (docs/architecture-decisions.md §Step types are property bundles).
# Code dispatches on properties and mechanism enums; kind names are
# data (registry rows + rule topics + seeds).
#
# Enforcement shape mirrors infra/lint/tier-import-audit.sh: grep,
# explicit allow-list, non-zero exit on anything new. The allow-list
# is a RATCHET — today it holds only the one permanent platform
# pin; remove an entry in the same change that converts its site.
# Never add an entry without a decision recorded in
# docs/architecture-decisions.md justifying it.
#
# Scope: crates/core, crates/modules, apps/web/src. Tests and seeds
# are exempt (tests pin fixtures; seeds ARE the data).
#
# The allow-list is held to lib/allowlist.sh's two rules: every entry
# names a file that exists, and every entry excused at least one match
# this run. DesignReviewPage.svelte sat here with a budget of 1 and 0
# matches from the day its `kind === 'review-design'` comparison moved
# to a surface id (backlog cdf2d959, audit §4) — a hole shaped like a
# file, waiting for the next match to land in it unrefused.
