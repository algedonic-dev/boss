# a-verb-declares-the-hosts-it-serves.sh — every ops verb says which
# hosts it serves, every named host is a real one, and a verb scoped to
# a host can actually run there.
#
# WHY. The ops-request allowlist (infra/ops/verbs/, one file per verb) had no notion of
# a host: a runner executed any verb a packet named. That was harmless
# while exactly one host had a runner, and stopped being harmless on
# 2026-09-11 when boss-gcp got one (backlog c3d06016). Eleven of the
# sixteen verbs name a script under the FORGE's checkout
# (/home/david/boss/infra/forge/…), which does not exist on boss-gcp —
# so an unscoped allowlist advertised a sixteen-verb vocabulary of which
# eleven could only fail on ENOENT, and `converge` or `rollback-to`
# filed against the bastion would have recorded an exec failure instead
# of a refusal. An exec failure is not a verdict (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis:
# a verdict must name what failed).
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   1. every verb declares a non-empty `hosts` list — the runner refuses
#      when `hosts` omits its HOST_ID, absent included, so a verb that
#      forgets to say reaches nobody; this is what makes that a decision
#      rather than an oversight
#   2. every host named is a REAL estate node id, read from the estate's
#      DECLARATION, infra/estate/estate.toml (the same ids a packet's
#      metadata.host carries) — never a list typed here
#   3. a verb whose argv[0] is an absolute path lives in ONE host's
#      filesystem, and may be scoped only to that host. This is the
#      check that would have caught the whole class: the forge scripts
#      are reachable by path only on the forge.
#   4. NO MUTATING VERB SERVES boss-gcp unless it is ADMITTED BY NAME
#      below, with its authorization. The host was made answerable,
#      not powerful: its set is the read-only, host-agnostic reads, and
#      widening is a reviewed per-verb change with its own
#      authorization — the same process reclaim-disk / converge /
#      publish-github-pr each went through (infra/ops/verbs/README.md
#      §Authorization). A mutating verb appearing here silently would be that
#      process skipped; one appearing in GCP_MUTATING_ADMITTED is that
#      process having happened, and this file is where it is noticed.
#   5. at least one verb serves boss-gcp, or the runner there answers
#      nothing and this lint is green over a dead door.
#   6. the runner actually READS `hosts`, or the field is decoration.
#
# The sibling is infra/lint/the-controls-are-bounded-verbs.sh, which
# asks whether a MUTATING verb is bounded and authorized; this one asks
# WHERE a verb runs. Both derive their rosters from the allowlist rather
# than listing verbs (§9a) — and the allowlist itself is DERIVED from the
# directory infra/ops/verbs/ by the one script the runner uses
# (infra/ops/verbs-allowlist.sh, 5086842d), so this lint reads exactly
# what the runner reads, assembled the same way.

# against seven declared nodes. A node declared that day was refused
# here as "not an estate node id" — confident, specific and wrong — and
