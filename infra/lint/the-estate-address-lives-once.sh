#!/usr/bin/env bash
# the-estate-address-lives-once.sh — the system of record's IP and the
# forge's are spelled in ONE tree file, infra/estate/estate.toml, and
# nowhere else a machine reads.
#
# WHY. Audit H10 (2026-09-18, backlog 5222163e, design 42277636):
# `10.20.0.34:7900` was in 47 files under three spellings while
# infra/dev/sor-url called itself "the ONE spelling", and the forge's
# `10.20.0.15` in 62 — Exec-line prefixes, `${JOBS_API:-…}` fallbacks,
# registry prefixes, clone URLs, a journal door. Every one of them is a
# fallback that keeps answering on the day the address moves (CLAUDE.md
# §Doors: a wrong target answers instead of erroring), and the
# boss.algedonic.dev cutover would have had to find them all. Now a
# host's install renders /etc/boss/sor.env from the source, units read it
# with EnvironmentFile=, scripts through infra/lib/sor.sh, and this lint
# is what stops the literal creeping back.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS. Both IPs are READ FROM THE SOURCE — this file carries
# neither — and every tracked file is scanned for them, except:
#
#   * the source itself, and this lint;
#   * docs (docs/, every *.md): prose about history names addresses;
#   * tests (crates/*/tests/, *.test.ts): fixtures are allowed to spell
#     the address they stub;
#   * migrations (infra/postgres/schema/): append-only history — the
#     estate rows and the credential issuer strings are what they were;
#   * comment lines (`#`): prose, like docs — see lines_with below;
#   * the ALLOWANCE below: a file that cannot read the env file yet, each
#     with the reason. A named set, never a count (§9a). An entry whose
#     file still exists but no longer carries the literal is STALE and
#     fails the lint — remove it. An entry whose file is gone is skipped
#     with a note: the bare-metal deletion (H7, e109bd71) and this car
#     land independently, and a stale entry must not red the train that
#     carries both.
#
# Exit 0 clean; 1 with every offending `file:line: text` on stderr; 3
# when the tree could not be read (lib/git-answer.sh).

.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml	the CI workflow: job-container image tags and the checkout-by-IP the runner needs before it has a checkout (ci-checks-out-from-the-forge.sh); the reclaim job's BOSS_JOBS_URL rides solo as a gate-blind car (follow-up)
.forgejo/workflows/install-smoke.yml	the nightly install-smoke workflow: its clone-by-IP on the forge runner (gate-blind, as ci.yml)
bl2.json	stray scratch tracked at the repo root (audit §Headline numbers); deleted by its own car
crates/core/boss-dispatcher/src/config.rs	the dispatcher's BOSS_FORGE_URL default, read as before (the CLI/Rust layer is out of this car: env is where units set it)

crates/orchestrators/boss-cli/src/credential.rs	BOSS_TRAIN_FORGE_URL default and a refusal message (the CLI reads env as before)
crates/orchestrators/boss-cli/src/doctor.rs	the CLI's BOSS_JOBS_URL default (reads env as before; a refusing default is a behaviour change for another car)

infra/cluster/manifests/boss-conservation-invariants.yaml	CronJob image
infra/cluster/manifests/boss-conductor.yaml	the conductor's image and BOSS_TRAIN_FORGE_URL — prod is the source instance; render-instance.sh substitutes only the instance keys

infra/gate-runner/gate-runner.yaml	the gate Job's images (a manifest rendered by gate.rs)
