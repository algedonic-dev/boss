# Lint against the "snapshot, not projection" anti-pattern that
# repeatedly bit the SPA — hand-maintained arrays of facts that
# silently drift from their real source of truth (boss-ports::lib
# for the service/port map, the brewery seed for employees, etc.).
#
# Checks:
#
#   1. `apps/web/src/_generated/ports.ts` is present and lists the
#      same service names as `boss-ports-list --json`. Catches the
#      case where someone committed without re-running the SPA
#      build, or edited the generated file by hand.
#
#   2. The two prior known-bad SPA files (`dev-server.ts` and
#      `it/monitoring/MonitoringPage.svelte`) don't reintroduce a
#      hand-maintained service list. Both must import from
#      `_generated/ports`; the lint just greps for the import.
#
# Usage: infra/lint/no-snapshot-arrays.sh
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean / 1 drift.

# BOTH generated copies. The fact lives three times — boss-ports (the

# check used to pin only the web copy. On 2026-08-13 the simulator copy
# was found 20 lines short, missing `search`, `views` and `campaigns`
# entirely, while the web copy was correct: the guarded copy stayed in
# sync and the unguarded one silently rotted. A guard that covers one of
# two duplicates is not a guard on the duplication, which is the whole
# point of CLAUDE.md §9a. Collapsing to a single shared module is the
# real fix; pinning both is the holding action until then.
