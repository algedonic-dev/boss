# invariant-register — the shape check on docs/invariants/.
#
# THE PRINCIPLE
# -------------
# Every load-bearing invariant declares how it is held
# (docs/design/design-conformance.md). The failure this guards against
# is not a wrong claim — it is an UNDECLARED one: "a claim with no
# enforcement is indistinguishable, at a glance, from one with
# enforcement." A register that lets an entry omit its enforcement
# class, or name a lint that was deleted two cars ago, reintroduces
# exactly the ambiguity it was written to remove.
#
# THE CHECKED PROPERTY
# --------------------
# The SHAPE of the register, never the truth of a claim. Specifically:
#
#   * every entry carries all seven keys, and no others;
#   * `id` is a unique, citable slug (a conformance finding cites an
#     id, so a duplicate silently merges two histories);
#   * `claim`, `source` and `enforcement` are non-empty, and
#     `enforcement` is one of enforced / checked / unenforced;
#   * enforced   → `mechanism` names a path that EXISTS ON DISK. This
#                  is the one check with teeth against rot: a lint
#                  deleted or renamed without touching the register
#                  fails here, by id.
#   * checked    → `mechanism` says how it is verified, and
#                  `last_verified` is a real YYYY-MM-DD date.
#   * unenforced → `note` says why, and `mechanism` is EMPTY. An
#                  unenforced invariant that names a mechanism is
#                  claiming enforcement it does not have.
#
#   * exactly ONE entry per file, and the file is named for its id.
#
# That last rule is why the register is a directory. As one file its
# entries appended at the tail, so two cars registering a learning on
# the same day conflicted on the same line; on 2026-08-15 resolving
# one such conflict dropped an entry's `[[invariant]]` header and
# folded its keys into the entry above, and THIS LINT SAID `ok`
# (b071994b). Two holes let that through and both are now shut: a
# duplicate key inside an entry is a finding, and the census asserts
# its own arithmetic — it used to print "43 declared (19 enforced, 4
# checked, 21 unenforced)", which does not add up, and exit 0.
#
# What this deliberately does NOT do is grade the strength of the
# declaration. An author may write `unenforced`, and that honesty is
# the point — anything else turns the rule into pressure to fake
# enforcement (design-conformance Q2).
#
# Following the no-secrets.sh precedent of checks that prove
# themselves, every run starts with a self-test: one planted fixture
# per malformed shape, each asserted caught by id AND by field, plus a
# well-formed fixture asserted clean. `--self-test` runs just that and
# stops.
#
# bash 3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no mapfile, no ${x,,}. The
# TOML subset parsed here is the one the register is written in —
# `[[invariant]]` headers and single-line `key = "value"` pairs.
#
# Usage: infra/lint/invariant-register.sh [--self-test]
# Exit:  0 clean / 1 findings or self-test failure
