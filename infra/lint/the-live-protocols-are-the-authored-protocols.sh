# the-live-protocols-are-the-authored-protocols — every protocol the
# running registry admits Jobs under is one this tree writes down.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The sibling one layer down is
# `infra/lint/the-live-rules-are-the-authored-rules.sh`, and this is the
# same defect in the same shape: a registry whose rows can be authored
# live through the API, a tree that is supposed to describe them, and
# nothing comparing the two. Measured 2026-09-10 against the live
# registry: EIGHTY-FOUR admitted workflow kinds, and TWELVE of them had
# no authored source anywhere in the tree — not a bundle file, not a
# tenant seed, not a Rust literal, not a migration. They were published
# through `POST /api/workflows` + publish and never written back.
#
# Twelve is not a list of curiosities. `gate-run` is the protocol every
# car's gate packet runs on; `publish-request` is how a branch from a
# credential-less workspace reaches the forge; `maintenance-sweep` is
# the chore family seven dispatcher clock rules spawn. Answering "what
# does the gate-run protocol require" meant querying production, a
# change to any of them was a live publish with no diff and no second
# reader, and a deployment built from this tree did not have them at
# all.
#
# NOT A COMPLAINT THAT PROTOCOLS ARE DATA. CLAUDE.md is explicit and
# right: "Adding a new workflow means adding a Workflow row, not
# touching core code", and the three-layers frame says a protocol that
# cannot be replaced without a deploy has leaked into the substrate.
# All of that stays true. The property here is narrower and does not
# contradict it: whatever the registry admits, the tree can SHOW you.
# Publishing a new version live stays legal; leaving the tree unable to
# describe it does not.
#
# THE CHECKED PROPERTY
# --------------------
# Live kinds are a subset of the kinds this TREE authors, plus the
# exemptions named below (empty, and meant to stay that way). Read from
# THIS tree deliberately, not from anything the deployment computes,
# because the tree under test is the one a car changes.
#
# FOUR AUTHORING HOMES, all of which count. A kind is authored if the
# tree says what it is, in any form a reader can read and a reviewer can
# diff:
#
#   1. infra/platform/workflows/<kind>.toml — the platform bundle, and
#      the destination. One kind per file, the stem IS the kind (the
#      loader refuses anything else; `platform_bundle.rs` pins it), so
#      `ls` answers "which kinds".
#   2. examples/<tenant>/seeds/workflows.toml — a tenant's bundle, one
#      file of `[[workflow]]` blocks, published by that tenant's prepare
#      step.
#   3. `platform_workflows()` in crates/core/boss-jobs/src/registry.rs —
#      Rust literals, reconciled into the registry on every boot. Being
#      retired into (1) by protocols-as-data; still authored until then.
#   4. An `INSERT INTO workflows` in infra/postgres/schema/ — how
#      `repair-a-train` arrived, and the reason this script reads
#      migrations at all. The packet that filed this gap first counted
#      seventeen and corrected itself to sixteen on exactly this check.
#
# Homes 3 and 4 are duplication this tree is moving away from, not
# endorsements. They count here because the question is "can a reader
# find out what this protocol is", and in both cases they can.
#
# ONE DIRECTION, on purpose. A kind authored with no live row is the
# EXPECTED state in two ways, neither of which is drift: between a
# protocol car's merge and the converge + seed behind it, and for every
# tenant bundle a deployment does not run (this tree ships two tenants;
# a deployment runs one). Failing on it would red cars for windows they
# do not control — the "an infrastructure refusal is not a consist
# failure" cost CLAUDE.md records. So it is REPORTED, never failed on.
#
# WHEN THE REGISTRY IS UNREACHABLE it SKIPS, loudly, and exits 3 —
# `LINT_CANNOT_ANSWER`, lib/git-answer.sh's word for "the machine could
# not answer": never 0, because a skip prints no `scanned` line and a
# clean exit with no count is exactly what lib/scanned.sh refuses; never
# 1, because nothing about the BRANCH was judged. Until 2026-09-18 it
# exited 0 on the argument that the gate ran on the forge host with no
# route here — no longer true (the gate runs in-cluster, design
# 128b5496) — and the day the system of record was rolling under a
# converge, the lint-of-lints pin redded gate 35f4ff0c for a lint that
# had scanned nothing (backlog a26f92c4). gate.sh maps exit 3 to a
# REFUSAL receipt (`refused`, not `failed`), which the conductor
# relaunches and strikes no car for. The static half below still runs,
# so a skip is never a no-op. What it must never do is treat "could not
# read" as "nothing to report": a wrong target
# answers instead of erroring (CLAUDE.md §Doors), so an answer that
# parses but is not an array of workflow rows is a FAILURE, and so is an
# EMPTY one — a registry admitting zero kinds is dead air, not a clean
# bill.
#
# THE SECOND CHECKED PROPERTY — a live row still SAYS what its file says
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The property above is about existence: whatever the registry admits,
# the tree can show you. It is satisfied by a file that exists and is
# WRONG, and on 2026-09-10 one was. `design-doc-review`'s live v1
# `description` described `boss-docs-api` parsing `### Qn:` headings,
# `/api/design/pending-decisions` and the flush jobs — every one of them
# deleted that day — while the tree file carried the corrected text.
# TWO mechanisms each declined to close the gap: the bundle seed is
# insert-if-missing, so a present row is skipped whole, and
# `bootstrap_reconcile`'s `kind_body_matches` excludes `description` as
# cosmetic, so it saw no drift and republished nothing (backlog
# e882b74c). The row was corrected by an operator publish at 02:53Z on
# 2026-09-11; this half is the mechanism that names the next one.
#
# THREE FIELDS, all scalar strings an operator reads and none of which
# changes what the protocol does: `description`, `label`, `category`.
# `owning_team` is deliberately out — the loader overrides the file's
# key, so a disagreement there could never be cleared by a publish. The
# comparator's own comment carries the reason for each inclusion and
# each exclusion.
#
# AND, SINCE 2026-09-15, FOUR STEP FACETS: the step count, the ordered
# title list, and each step's required-field set and label
# (`title_template`). Structural fields were out on the argument that a
# live row legitimately leads its file between a publish and the car
# that writes it down — true, and the reason drift is REPORTED rather
# than failed on, not a reason to leave it unmeasured. The measured
# cost of not looking (backlog 0ccf23ec): ship-a-change's live v31 had
# a `settled` step and a required `proof` field its file lacked, the
# daily measurement said "one description adrift", and publishing the
# file over the row — the obvious fix for the drift it DID report —
# would have deleted both. Predicates, kinds, field types and
# metadata_defaults stay out; they need the publish path's
# normalisation before an equality means anything. The step's `agent`
# block joined the facets on 2026-09-19 (backlog 1b847556): it is
# structural like `fields`, and a live row lacking it read "agree".
#
# NOT A CASE FOR WIDENING `kind_body_matches`. That function governs
# every bootstrap-created row, so widening it would change reconcile's
# behaviour for rows this problem is not about — and since
# `platform_workflows()` went empty on 2026-09-11 it iterates nothing,
# so widening it would compare nothing here either. Worth being exact:
# `label` and `category` ARE already in it and `description` alone is
# not, so for a bundle-authored kind nothing compares any of the three.
# That is the gap this half fills.
#
# A DRIFT IS REPORTED, NOT FAILED ON, under a bare invocation — the same
# tolerance the kind half gives the same window, read one field deeper:
# a car edits a description, merges, and the row does not move until an
# operator publishes. Failing would red every car in between, which is
# the churn argument that excluded the field from reconcile arriving
# again as a red gate. `--require-live` is the mode for a caller that
# can act on a verdict.
#
# Usage:  infra/lint/the-live-protocols-are-the-authored-protocols.sh
#           [--require-live] [--report-json <file>] [--self-test]
#
#   --require-live  For a caller with somewhere to put the answer (a
#                   sweep, a cadence, an operator asking the question
#                   directly). The live comparison MUST happen: an
#                   unreachable registry exits 75 instead of skipping to
#                   0, and a field drift is a verdict (2) rather than a
#                   report. A check that passes when it could not read
#                   is worse than no check.
#   --report-json   Write the SAME facts the text report prints, as one
#                   JSON object, to <file> — for a caller that files
#                   them rather than reads them (infra/protocol-drift.sh,
#                   the daily measurement on boss-gcp; backlog 19dec171).
#                   The verdict is unchanged by this flag. The file is
#                   written only when the live comparison RAN: a skip
#                   writes nothing and says so, because a report of no
#                   comparison would read as "no drift". Its shape is
#                   `write_report`'s comment below.
#   --self-test     Run the fixture cases and say what they proved.
#                   They run on every invocation regardless; the flag
#                   only makes them speak.
#
#   Exit codes:  0 clean (or drift, reported, bare invocation)
#                1 a failure of the tree — an unauthored live kind, a
#                  Rust literal, a stale exemption, an unreadable
#                  bundle file, or a comparison refused as vacuous
#                2 field drift, under --require-live only

# The fields compared, and the reason each one is on the list. All four
# are SCALAR STRINGS an operator reads, and none of them changes what
# the protocol DOES — which is exactly why nothing else compares them.
#
#   description  the sentence an operator reads to know what a protocol
#                is for. The measured instance: design-doc-review's live
#                v1 described `boss-docs-api`, `/api/design/pending-
#                decisions` and the flush jobs, all deleted on
#                2026-09-10, so the row sent a reader looking for a
#                service that is gone (backlog e882b74c). It is also
#                the ONE field `kind_body_matches` names as cosmetic and
#                skips.
#   label        the protocol's name in every list and tab that renders
#                it. A label disagreeing with its file means an operator
#                and a reviewer are talking about differently-named
#                things.
#   category     groups protocols in the UI, and has a measured defect
#                of its own: `maintenance_spec` put the DESCRIPTION in
#                the category column for all three chores (6c796f75).
#
# `owning_team` WAS on this list and came off it, which is worth keeping:
# the file's key is decorative. `seed_loader` ends its conversion with
# `spec.owning_team = default_owner` — "platform" for this bundle, the
# tenant id for a tenant's — so the TOML key is read and thrown away,
# and `boss workflow publish` reads the same loader. A disagreement
# there is therefore not a row lagging its file; it is a file claiming
# something the loader will not honour, and NO publish could ever clear
# it. A finding no action can close trains a reader to skip the whole
# report (§Diagnosis, "a check nobody reads").
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT COMPARED: `subject_kinds`, `metadata_schema`,
# `entitlements`, `metadata`, `on_complete_create`, and the parts of
# `steps` that STEP_FACETS below does not render (predicates, kinds,
# field types, metadata_defaults; NOT `agent`, which is compared — see
# the facet list). Those are STRUCTURAL — they decide
# what the protocol does — and they need the same normalisation the
# publish path applies (defaults filled, predicates parsed) before an
# equality means anything, which is a check of its own, not a line in
# this one. Also out: `version`, `status`, `created_at`,
# `authoring_job_id` — four columns with no TOML key at all, so the file
# cannot disagree with them.
FIELDS = ("label", "description", "category")

# THE STEP FACETS, compared since 2026-09-15 (backlog 0ccf23ec). Steps
# were on the not-compared list above, for the reason it still gives
# about normalisation — and the reason was true of `ready_when` and
# false of everything the live row and the file both state VERBATIM.
# The measured cost of leaving them out: ship-a-change's live v31
# carried a `settled` outcome step, a required `proof` field on
# `proven` (the machine-probe rule, v22) and a procedure on every step,
# while its file had eight steps and no `proof`; the daily measurement
# read "one description adrift" and said nothing about the step, so
# "fix the drift" — publishing the file over the row — would have
# DELETED the step and the requirement that makes proven a fact. Each
# facet is rendered on both sides as one scalar string, so it rides the
# same DRIFT line, the same windows and the same JSON report as a
# description, and a reader learns WHICH step and WHAT differs:
#
#   steps.count                 how many steps — the headline number
#   steps.titles                the ordered title list; a step on one
#                               side only shows up here, once, rather
#                               than as a per-step line against nothing
#   steps.<title>.required      the sorted names of that step's
#                               required fields — the completion
#                               contract; `proof` is the worked case
#   steps.<title>.title_template  the step's label as rendered; the
#                               same class as `label` one level up,
#                               and where pr-train's live v17 (yard
#                               grammar) differed from its file with
#                               nothing else to show for it
#   steps.<title>.agent         WHO runs the step (design c87fb59b car
#                               1): the block's keys as canonical JSON,
#                               `<absent>` when neither side has one.
#                               Added 2026-09-19 (backlog 1b847556):
#                               measured 2026-09-18 23:25Z, the live
#                               backlog-item v2 had no block on any
#                               step, its file had two, and this read
#                               "54 live rows agree with their file".
#                               Numbers compare as floats — the file
#                               spells `budget_usd = 5`, the registry
#                               hands back 5.0 through AgentSpec's f64
#                               — the same rule the publish path's
#                               step_view applies (publish-workflow.sh,
#                               #464). Held out for one day after that
#                               fix so a landing did not red every gate
#                               before the publish behind it; the loop
#                               closed on 2026-09-19 (live v3 carries
#                               both blocks).

# `write_report <file> <verdict>` reads the same variables the text
# report below prints from — `live_kinds`, `authored`, `unauthored`,
# `EXEMPT`, `fields_out` (the comparator's TSV lines), `pending`,
# `tenant_lines`, `problems` — so the two cannot say different things:
# one source, two renderings (CLAUDE.md §9a). Nothing is re-derived and
# nothing is reduced that the text does not also reduce: the DRIFT
# windows are the same 90-character excerpts, with both full copies at
# their named homes (the file in the tree, the row at GET /api/workflows).

# Home 3: the Rust literals inside `platform_workflows()`. EMPTY since
# 2026-09-11, and the check below is what keeps it that way.
#
# This home was always a tolerated waypoint, never a destination: a kind
# here is a protocol that cannot be changed without building and
# shipping a binary, which is CLAUDE.md's own definition of a protocol
# that has leaked into the substrate. The last four left on 2026-09-11
# (`design-doc-review` and the three `maintenance_spec` chores), and the
# concrete cost of the form is on the record — `maintenance_spec` put its
# description in the CATEGORY column for all three, and because
# `bootstrap_reconcile` re-asserts a code spec on every boot the wrong
# value could not drift back on its own and every new deployment
# reproduced it (6c796f75).
#
# So the roster is now checked EMPTY rather than merely scraped. The
# body is read between the signature and the first line closing it at
# column 0; two entry shapes are recognised — a kebab-case string
# literal (`maintenance_spec("maintenance-backup", …)`) and a
# no-argument `<name>_spec()` call, whose kind is its name with
# underscores as dashes (`design_doc_review_spec()` →
# `design-doc-review`) — and they still feed the authored set, so a
# literal put back tomorrow is counted as authoring and NOT reported as
# an unauthored live kind. It fails on the narrower ground that a
# protocol belongs in the bundle.
#
# An empty roster must also LOOK empty, because "the scrape saw nothing"
# and "there is nothing to see" have to stay distinguishable: the body
# with comments and whitespace stripped is required to be exactly
# `vec![]`. That is what keeps this honest against an entry shape the
# two patterns above do not recognise — such an entry leaves the body
# non-empty, and a non-empty body is a failure whether or not a kind
# name could be read out of it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Field half — a live row still says what its FILE says.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The half above asks whether the tree can DESCRIBE every live protocol.
# This one asks whether the description is still TRUE, which is a
# different question with its own measured instance: design-doc-review's
# live v1 `description` named `boss-docs-api`, `/api/design/pending-
# decisions` and the flush jobs — every one deleted on 2026-09-10 — while
# the tree file carried the corrected text, and TWO mechanisms each
# declined to notice. The bundle seed is insert-if-missing, so a present
# row is skipped whole. `bootstrap_reconcile`'s `kind_body_matches`
# excludes `description` as cosmetic, so it saw no drift and
# republished nothing (backlog e882b74c).
#
# NOT A CASE FOR WIDENING `kind_body_matches`, and the reason is
# stronger than the churn argument that excluded the field: since
# 2026-09-11 `platform_workflows()` is EMPTY, so reconcile iterates
# nothing and touches none of these rows. Widening its comparison
# today would change behaviour only for rows this problem is not
# about, and would still compare nothing here. It is also worth being
# exact about what that function already covers — `label`, `category`
# and `owning_team` ARE in it, and `description` alone is not — which
# is why all three are compared here: for a bundle-authored kind,
# nothing compares any of them.
#
# REPORTED, NEVER FAILED ON, in the bare invocation. The direction is
# the same legitimate window the half above tolerates, read one field
# deeper: a car edits a description in the tree, merges, and the live
# row does not change until an operator publishes a new version. Failing
# would red every car from that merge until the publish — the churn
# argument that excluded the field from reconcile, re-arriving as a red
# gate. `--require-live` is the mode for a reader that can act: there a
# drift exits 2.
