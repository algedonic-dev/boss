#!/usr/bin/env bash
# no-employee-id-literal.sh — production code does not name a person.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (backlog 3c23662d, design 42277636 first wave, audit
# H6). On 2026-09-18 fourteen production sites carried `"emp-david"` as
# the owner of every packet the platform files — every car
# (Tier-1 boss-jobs `car.rs`), every gate-run, every design doc, every
# conductor alarm, every estate/cadence/sensor/DNS alarm, the forge
# watchdog's alert and the nightly install-smoke red — and the workflow
# bootstrap walk signed its synthetic approvals `"emp-cto"`. Each one was
# a fact about ONE deployment written into code every deployment runs:
# on the playground the id names nobody, on an OSS install it names
# nobody, and the day Algedonic LLC hires a second operator (decided
# 2026-09-16) every alarm still lands on the first one, forever, unless
# fourteen files are edited in step.
#
# THE RULE. Who the platform owner IS is registry data — the people
# roster answers it (`role=platform-admin`, the first hire), and
# `boss_core::platform_owner` is the ONE port every filer reads it
# through (`BOSS_PLATFORM_OWNER` is the explicit override a launcher or
# unit may carry). A signer is the actor doing the signing, read off the
# header the call already sends. So a literal `emp-<name>` in production
# code is refused: an employee id is READ, never written.
#
# WHAT IS EXEMPT, and each is a judgement a reader can check:
#   * tests — `*/tests/*`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*/testdata/*`,
#     `*/fixtures/*`, a Rust test module declared as a whole file
#     (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` in the parent — lib/test-file.sh, the
#     predicate no-wallclock shares; backlog e9c77544), and every
#     `#[cfg(test)]` region of a Rust file (a top-level one runs to the
#     next column-0 `}`; an indented one to the closing brace at its
#     own indent, or the one statement it guards). A test names people
#     because it stages a roster.
#   * example seeds — `examples/` and `crates/tenants/` (the two example
#     tenants' `prepare` modules ARE their seed data: emp-cto, emp-coo and
#     emp-ceo are Algedonic Ales' founding operators, not the platform's).
#   * test infrastructure — `crates/core/boss-testing/` (its `src/` is
#     the harness every test runs under; `emp-smoke` is a fixture user).
#   * prose — a comment may name a person to tell the story; several do.
#   * the PLATFORM identities, which are not people: `emp-bootstrap-admin`
#     (the deployment's own transitional identity, declared ONCE as
#     `BOOTSTRAP_IDENTITY` in boss-people and retired by the first real
#     platform-admin hire) and every `id` the operator baseline hires in
#     infra/operator-baseline/operator_hires.toml (`emp-audit` today) —
#     READ from that file, not listed here, so the file stays the one
#     definition (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#   * a DECLARED site: a literal that is a placeholder the code writes
#     for someone else to rename (the tenant scaffold) or an example
#     tenant's seeded id the sim round-robins (boss-sim) says so where
#     it sits — on the line, or in the five lines above it:
#
#         // employee-id-ok: <at least three words of reason>
#
#     No list in this file, on purpose: a marker cannot drift from the
#     line it sits on, and fewer than three words is not a reason.
#
# Files read: `*.rs *.sh *.ts *.svelte *.toml *.yaml *.yml` under
# crates/ infra/ apps/ libs/. SQL is not read: a migration that seeds an
# identity is data, and migrations are append-only anyway.
