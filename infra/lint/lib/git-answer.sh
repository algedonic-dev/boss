# git-answer.sh — the one place a lint asks git something, and the only
# place that can tell "git answered, and the answer is no" apart from
# "git did not answer".
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured 2026-09-11, backlog 6b2f4a1a. git was
# refusing every command in a gate workspace (dubious ownership as uid
# 65534, exit 128). Of the lints that ask git a question, FOUR reported
# a tree they had never read:
#
#   no-session-paths     printed `clean`, exit 0   (git grep ... || true)
#   one-palette          printed `clean`, exit 0   (git grep ... || true)
#   a-new-style-has-a-caller   `no trunk ref found — skipping`, exit 0
#   a-kind-bundle-does-not-tighten  same, exit 0
#
# and two invented a remediation:
#
#   migrations-append-only   `no trunk ref found … Fetch the trunk`
#   steptype-bundle-ratchet  the same, both exit 1
#
# The trunk was present in all six cases. Fetching it would have changed
# nothing. The worst of those behaviours is not the refusal — it is the
# CERTIFICATION: a green check on a tree nothing looked at is the
# under-covering gate this repo keeps paying for, and it is invisible by
# construction.
#
# THE RULE. `grep`, `git grep`, `git rev-parse --verify --quiet` and
# friends already distinguish the two answers for you: exit 1 means "no,
# and I looked", exit >1 means "I could not look". `|| true` and
# `2>/dev/null` throw exactly that distinction away — the first discards
# the status, the second discards git's explanation — and what is left is
# a confident sentence with nothing behind it.
#
# THE STATUS. A lint that cannot answer exits 3, never 0 and never 1:
#
#   0  the lint read the tree and the tree is clean
#   1  the lint read the tree and found a violation — a fact about the
#      BRANCH, which is the author's to fix
#   3  the lint never read the tree — a fact about the MACHINE, which no
#      author can fix by editing code
#
# Why a third code rather than plain 1. CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: "an
# infrastructure refusal is not a consist failure… recorded as a plain CI
# failure it strikes every car aboard". Exit 1 erases the distinction at
# the point where it is still cheap to keep; nothing downstream can
# recover it afterwards, because the text of a lint's message is not a
# contract. Exit 3 is already this tree's word for it —
# `infra/safe-cargo.sh`, `infra/forge/journal-read.sh` ("UNREACHABLE →
# SKIPS LOUDLY (exit 3). Never 0"), `boss prove --unattended`,
# `infra/cluster/undeclared-objects.sh` — so a reader who knows the
# vocabulary reads it right today.
#
# What each reader does with it NOW, measured rather than assumed:
#
#   the consist check (`boss-cli` train.rs `run_one_lint`) maps every
#   code other than 0/126/127 to `LintResult::Failed`, and a failed
#   cheap lint "opens no PR, strikes no car, and leaves every one of
#   them boardable carrying a reason that names the lint". That is
#   already the correct handling of an infrastructure refusal, so exit 3
#   needs no change there. Deliberately NOT mapped to `Unrunnable`:
#   that is a warning the train PROCEEDS past, which would turn a lint
#   that read nothing into a boarding.
#
#   the per-car gate (`infra/gate.sh` `check_lint()`) records exit 3 as
#   a REFUSAL the way its disk floor does — `GATE_REFUSAL` naming the
#   lint and its first refusal line, `write_receipt "refused"`, exit 2 —
#   which `train_gate::standing` reads as `Standing::Refused` and
#   relaunches, striking no car. Until 2026-09-18 `check()` knew only
#   pass/fail and a 3 was a plain red: gate 35f4ff0c went red on
#   `the-live-protocols-are-the-authored-protocols` while the system of
#   record was rolling (backlog a26f92c4). gate.sh sources THIS file for
#   the number, so the two cannot drift.
#
# SOURCING A HELPER IS THE FIRST QUESTION THE MACHINE MUST ANSWER
# (backlog c3364c85, 2026-09-18). Every lint sourced its helpers with a
# bare `. "$LINT_DIR/lib/x.sh"` under `set -uo pipefail` (no -e), so a
# failed source was one line on stderr and the lint kept running with
# the functions it needed missing: a pin built its synthetic tree
# without lib/scanned.sh, the lint under test ran with `lint_scanned`
# undefined — command-not-found, then `ok`, exit 0 — and the pin passed
# for months. Under `set -e` the same failure is exit 1, a red on the
# branch for a fault of the machine. So every helper source line reads
#
#   . "$LINT_DIR/lib/x.sh" || exit 3
#
# — the literal, because this constant is what the line is failing to
# load. The pin every_helper_source_in_a_lint_exits_cannot_answer_when_
# it_fails (a_lint_that_scanned_nothing_is_red.rs) reads the number
# from the definition below and names any source line without it.
#
# USAGE
#   . "$LINT_DIR/lib/git-answer.sh" || exit 3
#   LINT=my-lint
#   hits=$(git_answer "$LINT" 0,1 grep -nE "$pat" -- apps/) || exit $?
#   #                          ^ the statuses that are ANSWERS; anything
#   #                            else is a refusal, printed on stderr,
#   #                            and `git_answer` returns 3.
#
# The answer-status set is per-command and there is no safe default, so
# it is required at every call site:
#   git grep            0 = hits, 1 = no hits
#   rev-parse --verify --quiet   0 = resolved, 1 = no such ref
#   merge-base          0 = found, 1 = no common ancestor
#   ls-files, diff, show, ls-tree   0 only
# `git cat-file -e <tree>:<path>` is deliberately not used anywhere in
# this tree any more: it exits 128 BOTH for "that path is not in that
# tree" and for "this repository is unreadable", so the two cases cannot
# be told apart at all. `git ls-tree --name-only <tree> -- <path>` is the
# readable form — exit 0 with empty output means absent, and only a real
# failure is non-zero.

# The exit status of "I could not answer". Exported so a self-test that
# re-enters a lint's functions in a child shell sees the same number.
