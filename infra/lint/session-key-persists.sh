#!/usr/bin/env bash
# session-key-persists.sh — the gateway's session key must be loaded
# from a path on a volume that survives a restart.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-26). `BOSS_SESSION_KEY` names a KEY and holds
# a PATH:
#
#     let session_key_path: std::path::PathBuf = std::env::var("BOSS_SESSION_KEY")
#         .unwrap_or_else(|_| "/var/lib/boss-gateway/session.key".into())
#         .into();
#
# The Deployment supplied it from a Secret — 64 hex characters that look
# exactly like a signing key. The gateway took those characters as a
# RELATIVE PATH, resolved them against the container's working directory,
# found no file there, minted a fresh random key, and wrote it to a file
# literally named after the secret on the ephemeral overlay filesystem.
#
# Nothing failed. Nothing logged an error. Every deploy simply issued a
# new signing key, so every session cookie in existence stopped
# verifying and every operator was signed out. There were three deploys
# on the day this was found, and the symptom reported was "again" — a
# person being bounced to /login and assuming the site was down. The
# site was up the whole time.
#
# Two properties are pinned, and the second is the one that matters:
#
#   1. the variable is not fed from a Secret — a secret VALUE here is
#      silently read as a filename, which is the whole bug;
#   2. the path it names lives under a mountPath backed by a
#      persistentVolumeClaim — because a key written to the container
#      filesystem is a new key on every restart, which is the same
#      outage wearing a different hat.
#
# The default in main.rs (/var/lib/boss-gateway/session.key) satisfies
# neither in this deployment: nothing is mounted there. So "just unset
# it" is not a fix, and this lint says so by checking the manifest
# rather than the code.
