# a-pg-test-declares-its-feature — every integration test that reaches
# for a crate's Postgres adapter is declared to Cargo with
# `required-features = ["postgres"]`, so `cargo test -p <crate>` with
# default features compiles instead of failing on an unresolved import.
#
# WHY. The gate runs `--all-features`, so it never saw this: on
# 2026-09-14 five `*_pg.rs` tests in boss-jobs (a_completion_names_its_
# actor_pg, a_day_of_jobs_lists_newest_first_pg, a_node_declares_its_
# roles_pg, job_edges_pg, station_flow_pg) had no [[test]] entry, and a
# builder's plain `cargo test -p boss-jobs` failed to compile on main
# with `unresolved import boss_jobs::PgJobs` — a red that says nothing
# about the tree. Sixteen sibling tests had the entry; the five were
# the ones added after the last person remembered. A rule remembered is
# not a mechanism (CLAUDE.md §9a); this is the mechanism.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS. For every crate under crates/ whose Cargo.toml declares
# a `postgres` feature: each tests/*_pg.rs, and each tests/*.rs that
# mentions the crate's Pg adapter (`Pg[A-Z]` or `postgres::`), has a
# `[[test]]` entry naming it with `required-features` including
# "postgres". Reads the tree only; runs on every gate.
