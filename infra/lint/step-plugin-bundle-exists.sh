# Every active step_plugins row points at a bundle that exists.
#
# WHY. A step plugin is TWO artefacts that must agree: a row in
# `step_plugins` naming a `frontend_url`, and a JavaScript file at
# `infra/step-plugins/<that name>`. Nothing connected them. They are
# written in different languages, land in different directories, and
# neither one fails to load if the other is absent.
#
# WHERE A ROW IS DECLARED. Since 2026-09-18 (backlog 393d3234,
# consolidation H4, car 2) a row lives in the platform bundle,
# `infra/platform/step-plugins/<kind>.toml`, which the seed publishes
# insert-if-missing at every start; the seven migrations that declared
# rows before that day stay as history and still produce rows on a
# fresh database. Both are read here: a bundle file whose JS is missing
# is the same broken step as a migration's, and a migration row whose
# JS was deleted is still live on every deployment that ran it.
#
# WHAT THE FAILURE LOOKS LIKE. The SPA prefers a plugin over its
# built-in surface whenever the registry has an active row for a step's
# kind (`apps/web/src/steps/StepSurface.svelte` → `hasActivePluginFor`).
# So a row whose bundle is missing does not fall back — it commits to
# the plugin path and then 404s fetching it. The step renders empty or
# broken on the ONE surface a person needs in order to act, and it
# happens only in a deployed environment, because the row lives in the
# database and the file lives in the image. Nothing in a local test run
# looks at either.
#
# The reverse — a bundle with no row — is deliberately NOT an error. A
# bundle can be committed before the migration that activates it, which
# is the normal order for authoring one, and `checklist.js`/`sign-off.js`
# back kinds the SPA renders inline.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It reads the migrations, not a live database, so
# it cannot see a row inserted by hand or a bundle missing from a built
# image. It catches the authoring mistake at the point it enters the
# tree, which is where it is cheap.
