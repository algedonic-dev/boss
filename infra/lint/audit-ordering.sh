# Causal / temporal ordering sweep over the audit-log-derived
# projections. Per docs/design/correctness-protocol.md, the audit log
# is generated through the live API, whose write-time guards
# (step-blocker 409, ready_when readiness, ledger period-lock) force
# realistic event ordering. This script re-reads the resulting
# projection tables and asserts that ordering actually held — a
# regression net that fires if a seed shortcut, a reordered dispatcher
# handler, or a bad happened_on ever lands events out of causal order.
#
# Unlike conservation-invariants.sh (which checks *steady-state*
# conserved quantities — FG-at-cost closure, WIP burndown, etc. that
# only settle over a full regen), these invariants hold at ANY point in
# the sim, so they are safe to gate a short-window install smoke test.
#
# Each query SELECTs rows that *violate* the invariant; empty = holds.
#
# Usage:
#   PGPASSWORD=boss infra/lint/audit-ordering.sh
# Connection params (override with env vars):
#   PGHOST=127.0.0.1  PGUSER=boss  PGDATABASE=boss

Events landed in an order that couldn't happen in a real run. The audit
log is the system of record, so this is a generation bug (a seed
shortcut, a reordered side-effect handler, or a bad happened_on), never
something to patch in the projection. Trace the offending aggregate's
events in audit_log and fix the JobKind / handler that emitted them out
of order. See docs/design/correctness-protocol.md.
