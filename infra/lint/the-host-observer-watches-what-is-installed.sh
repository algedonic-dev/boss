# the-host-observer-watches-what-is-installed.sh — the host-units
# observer's watch roster must BE the set of timer units the installer
# installs on that host, derived, not a list somebody typed twice.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-10 the question "is
# boss-ml-inference-batch.timer installed on boss-gcp?" had no read path
# (backlog 68757702). The observer answered — `GET
# /api/estate/observations?scope=host-units` returned a clean, confident
# observation — and it watched TWO units, so every other unit on that
# host was outside what it watched BY CONSTRUCTION and its absence from
# the answer said nothing at all. Reasoning from the tree instead
# produced a WRONG conclusion ("the unit has never run") against a
# reading taken over ssh that showed it firing and FAILING nightly since
# 2026-08-17, 23 consecutive status=22. A correction had to be written
# onto the alarm it was filed against.
#
# That is CLAUDE.md §Doors' rule in its purest form — "a wrong target
# answers instead of erroring" — and the repair is §9a's: the roster is
# DERIVED from the installer's rows (infra/gcp/install-units.sh, whose
# rows are infra/estate/roles.toml), the one place that knows what is
# installed, so the watch list cannot drift from the install list. A
# hand-written watch list holds no information its source does not.
# (Until 2026-09-18 the rows were the TIMERS array of the bare-metal
# deploy script, scraped as shell; that script is deleted, e109bd71.)
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   1. the observer answers `--roster` without touching systemd or the API
#   2. every installable roles.toml row contributes BOTH halves of its pair —
#      the .timer (is it installed and armed) and the .service (did it
#      run, and what did it exit with) — minus a named exclusion set
#   3. boss-ml-inference-batch.timer, the unit the measured failure was
#      about, is in the roster
#   4. the exclusion set is small and every entry is justified in the file
#   5. the unit file carries NO second copy of the list (the collapse)
#   6. an unreadable installer REFUSES (EX_CONFIG) rather than
#      falling back to a shorter list — a smaller roster would answer a
#      smaller question, confidently
#   7. under a host's ROLES the roster is exactly the installer's
#      `in-role` rows, both halves — a row the host's roles do not name
#      is not watched. The measured cost of the roster ignoring roles
#      (2026-09-15): the legacy-stack role left boss-gcp, its ten chores
#      were uninstalled, and the observer filed twelve urgent
#      `unit_unhealthy` alarms for units read `not-found` every five
#      minutes — a broken watch list reported as a broken host
#   8. the ops-request runner is watched exactly where it is installed —
#      where infra/ops/install-ops-runner.sh --in-role says this host's
#      roles give it one — both halves, and nowhere else. It is not a
#      roles.toml row (it fires every minute; boss-gcp-converges-itself.sh
#      refuses it as one), so the row derivation alone never reached it:
#      on 2026-09-22/23 boss-ops-runner was red every minute on a host
#      whose observer posted a clean reading every five, and post-mortem
#      3c3b202c found no estate record of it at all (backlog bf362f25)
