# Full reset of the brewery demo back to "seeded day 0".
#
# The demo builds itself live (see infra/seed-brewery-tenant.sh), so
# "reset to baseline" means: drop the live DB, re-apply schema +
# reference data + the brewery tenant seed, prime the clock to the demo
# epoch, and restart the sim. The sim then rebuilds the 12-month demo
# from scratch.
#
# This is the heavy, host-level reset (drop + reseed, ~1-2 min). The
# in-app "Reset" button (the restart-epoch endpoint) is the light path:
# it trims the audit_log back to epoch_baseline_audit_id — which the
# tenant seed stamps — without dropping the DB.
#
# Sequence:
#   1. Stop every boss service holding a DB connection.
#   2. Drop + recreate the live `boss` DB (re-applies schema).
#   3. Restart core services (jobs-api reconciles platform JobKinds).
#   4. Apply brewery Class registry rows (POST /api/classes/batch from classes.json).
#   5. Seed operator-baseline hires + bootstrap-admin, project them
#      (FK targets for the tenant seed's account team members).
#   6. Prime sim_clock to the demo epoch (2025-04-01).
#   7. Seed the brewery tenant (JobKinds + policy + accounts/vendors/
#      data) and stamp the reset baseline — infra/seed-brewery-tenant.sh.
#   8. Rebuild projections + GL from audit_log.
#   9. Start boss-brewery-sim — the live tick resumes from epoch_start.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./infra/postgres/reset-to-baseline.sh
#
# Optional env:
#   BOSS_DEMO_EPOCH_START=2025-04-01   # demo day 0
#   BOSS_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL=…       # platform-admin to re-seed
