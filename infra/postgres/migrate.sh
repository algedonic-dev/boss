# migrate.sh — the only path schema takes into a database.
#
# The ordered migration list IS schema/*.sql, sorted by its NNN- prefix.
# Files not yet recorded in schema_migrations are applied in order, each
# in one transaction WITH its bookkeeping row — so a re-run never
# re-applies, and a failed migration leaves nothing behind. A schema
# change is a NEW file, never an edit to an applied one (expand/contract:
# see docs/design/schema-migrations.md). Dropping a file in the directory
# is the whole act of adding a migration; there is no list to update.
#
#   ./migrate.sh                          # apply what's pending (psql from env)
#   ./migrate.sh -- psql -h db -U boss -d boss
#   ./migrate.sh --without ledger         # skip matching entries (not recorded)
#   ./migrate.sh --baseline               # record everything, run nothing
#   ./migrate.sh --baseline -- sudo -n -u postgres psql -d boss
#
# Everything after `--` is the psql command to run (default: `psql`,
# configured by the usual PG* env vars); migrate.sh appends its own
# flags, and streams SQL over stdin so the command never needs to read
# the repo's files itself (sudo -u postgres across a 0750 home dir).
#
# --baseline exists for databases that predate the runner: their tables
# already exist, so every current migration is recorded as applied
# without being run. Needed exactly once per pre-existing deployment.
# A database that visibly predates the runner (core tables present,
# nothing recorded) is refused rather than re-applied from scratch.
#
# Contract pinned by crates/core/boss-testing/tests/migrate_sh.rs.

# THE MIGRATION ORDER IS THE DIRECTORY, NUMERICALLY SORTED. There is no
# manifest file, deliberately.
#
# There used to be one, and adding a migration meant appending a line to
# its tail. That made the tail a contended line: any two cars carrying a
# migration at the same time conflicted there on merge. It cost four
# re-rails on 2026-08-13 and stranded two more cars on 2026-08-14 ("left
# for the next train"), which is more disruption than the file ever
# prevented — it held no information the directory listing did not
# already carry, in the same order.
#
# Numeric sort on the `NNN-` prefix, not lexical: `100-` must land after
# `20-`, and a plain `sort` puts it before.
