# Validate the brewery sim: run a full 12-month sim against the live
# API and assert it reconstructs + reconciles cleanly. This is the CI
# correctness gate the release leans on — the demo itself builds live
# (see infra/seed-brewery-tenant.sh + the quickstart launchers).
#
# Sequence (per docs/design/projection-rebuilders.md §E):
#
#   1. Drop + recreate the live `boss` DB.
#   2. Bring services up (jobs-api reconciles `job-kind-design`
#      via platform_kinds()).
#   3. Run `boss-brewery-sim prepare` → the converged prepare_model:
#      publishes the brewery JobKinds (real `job-kind-design` Jobs,
#      full audit_log provenance), seeds tenant policy grants, and
#      POSTs accounts / vendors / employees / messages / FG + raw +
#      asset opening balances. The SAME seed code the live demo runs
#      (seed-brewery-tenant.sh → boss-brewery-sim prepare) — so CI
#      can't drift from the demo. (Replaces the old separate
#      brewery-bootstrap + policy-bootstrap + data-seed trio.)
#   5. Pre-seed check: raw inventory_items come from step 3's prepare
#      (parts.toml); warn if the SKU file is missing.
#   6. Run `boss-brewery-sim run` for 365 days from 2025-04-01,
#      against the live API, hard-fail. The SAME run_brewery_live
#      driver the live daemon's per-tick loop is built on. Any
#      non-2xx aborts immediately so we fix the bug instead of
#      letting drift accumulate.
#   7. Wait for dispatcher rules + downstream services to drain
#      their NATS queues.
#   8. Run boss-rebuild-all to verify every projection
#      reconstructs cleanly from audit_log alone.
#   9. Run boss-audit-integrity-check for dangling-FK violations.
#
# Hard requirement: zero errors at every step. Any failure aborts
# the script with a non-zero exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./infra/postgres/validate-brewery-sim.sh
#
# Optional env:
#   BOSS_REGEN_DAYS=14         # short dry run for sanity (default 365)
