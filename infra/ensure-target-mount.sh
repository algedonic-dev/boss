# Ensure `/opt/boss/target` is a symlink into the dedicated
# build mount (`/var/lib/boss-build/target`) instead of a real
# directory on the OS root disk.
#
# Why this matters: the repo's release build produces ~10 GB of
# artifacts. On the GCP VMs that ship the playground we have a
# 48 GB root disk and a separate 98 GB build mount at
# `/var/lib/boss-build` (per `infra/oss-quickstart`). When
# `/opt/boss/target` is a real directory on `/`, those 10 GB
# pile onto root and a couple of release rebuilds will fill it
# and crash systemd. We saw exactly that during the v1.0.5
# Clock-as-service deploy: root went from 38 G → 38 G → 47 G →
# OOM on the next build.
#
# The intended setup (per `infra/deploy-services.sh:548`):
# `/opt/boss/target` is a symlink to `/var/lib/boss-build/target`.
# Fresh checkouts + `git clean -dfx` periodically break the
# symlink — running this script idempotently restores it.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./infra/ensure-target-mount.sh
#
# Safe to run at any time. If `target/` is already a symlink to
# the build mount → no-op. If it's a real directory → moves
# contents to the mount + replaces with a symlink. If the build
# mount itself isn't there → exits 0 with a warning (some dev
# hosts run target on root by design).
