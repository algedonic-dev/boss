# conductor.sh — terminal entry point for the pr-train conductor. The
# logic lives in `boss train` (crates/orchestrators/boss-cli/src/
# train.rs) since directive 26d61c97 retired python from the BOSS
# system. The systemd timers that used to enter here are gone
# (protocol-cadence): the schedule is rows in the cadence_rules
# registry, executed by the supervised `boss train cadence` loop
# (boss-train.service). This shim survives for humans — a terminal
# and a dry run keep the flags they always passed.

# build-release.sh resolves cargo from CARGO_BIN or $HOME — under the
# cadence service HOME is the service user's, where the toolchain lives.

# Translate the historical flags to `boss train` verbs. --preflight
# wins over --reconcile-only, same as the python argv scan (preflight
# returned before reconcile was consulted); everything else —
# --dry-run today — passes through.
