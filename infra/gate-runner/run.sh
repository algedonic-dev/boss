# gate-runner/run.sh — one gate, one Job, self-reporting.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-22/23 gates ran as tmux trees inside the
# boss-dev pod and died four different deaths, none their own fault:
# a converge replaced the pod (twice), container limits made exec
# scopes reap the tmux server, a shared 100Gi target filled and turned
# "No space left on device" into fake code failures, and a cold
# container's first webServer boot mass-failed a mocked suite in 20s.
# Each death was reconstructed from journals after a human asked "how
# are we looking". This script is the other shape: a Kubernetes Job
# with its own clone, its own disk, a database sidecar, and a receipt
# it reports to the gate-run packet itself — so the SoR knows the
# verdict without anyone grepping a pod.
#
# Runs inside the boss-ci image (see gate-runner.yaml). Required env:
#   GATE_BRANCH        branch to gate (fetched from the forge)
#   GATE_RUN_JOB_ID    the gate-run packet this run reports to
# Optional:
#   GATE_MODE          "--auto" for scoped gates, empty for full
#   FORGE_URL          default http://10.20.0.15:3000/david/boss.git

# --- report-back (begin) ---
# THE REPORT RETRIES, because the system of record rolls.
#
# This used to be one call. A gate ends 10-40 minutes after it starts,
# the SoR Recreate-rolls for 30-90s on every train converge, and every
# merge now converges within a minute of landing - so any gate whose
# last minute overlapped a roll made its single report into a dark API,
# printed a WARN, and exited 0. Four greens were lost that way on the
# night of 2026-09-07 (backlog 23188cc5), each re-proven by hand at ~10
# minutes of cluster time. The verdict existed the whole time, in this
# pod's log; nothing was retrying the one call that mattered.
#
# So: `report` is a loop over `report_once`, sleeping GATE_REPORT_BACKOFF
# between attempts (~5 minutes in all, several times a roll), and it
# tells the two failure shapes apart. NOBODY ANSWERED (connection
# refused, timeout, empty reply, 5xx) is a roll and is retried. A REFUSAL
# (any other 4xx, or a step-selection disagreement) is about the write
# itself - a frozen step, a packet this runner does not understand - and
# retrying it for five minutes would only delay the terminal-packet
# branch below. Every attempt is logged, so a reader of the Job log sees
# the roll the runner rode out.
#
# The block is bracketed so boss-testing's gate_runner_report_retry test
# can lift it verbatim and run it against a stub SoR; the pod receives
# exactly one file, so the code cannot live anywhere else.
GATE_REPORT_BACKOFF="${GATE_REPORT_BACKOFF:-5 10 20 30 45 60 60 60}"

# THE REPORT-BACK RECORDS ITS OWN STORY, on the receipt the packet keeps.
#
# Everything the loop below knows about the roll it rode out - how many
# attempts, how many seconds, whether the system of record went dark at
# all - it prints to the pod log, and the pod log is reaped with the Job.
# The packet, which is the record, said only "green". During train #282's
# converge two gates reported cleanly across a dark SoR and there is no
# record anywhere that it happened.
#
# §Diagnosis: "an alarm that reports through its subject dies with it".
# The runner cannot report an outage THROUGH the API that is out - but
# it can carry its own account inside the payload it finally lands, so
# the outage is visible afterwards instead of only while it is happening.
# These three are set by `report` and read by `report_once` at the moment
# of the write, because the story is only true as of the attempt making
# it.

# The 2026-09-09 work made the receipt name the failing CHECK: 62 entries

# into a six-minute read. It stopped one level short. Gate-run 9dc722d2
# recorded verdict=failed with `test` correctly marked the single failure
# and nothing whatsoever about WHICH test - and the check name is not
# what a reader acts on. The failing test name was one grep away in this
# pod's log, and the pod log is REAPED: the receipt is the durable record
# (backlog 4a4d1227).
#
# So the sections this script already pulls out of gate.log for the
# stdout replay are also parsed for the part that has to survive - the
# failing test names, and the panic line with its file:line - and merged
# into the receipt as `fails` before it is reported.
#
# ONE PARSER. The replay and `fails` answer the same question ("what did
# the failed checks say"), so gate.log is read once and the replay text
# is written to a file the block below merely prints (CLAUDE.md §9a: a
# fact that would otherwise live twice). That also moves the old
# `|| tail -200` shell fallback INSIDE the parser, where it can say why

# `fails` IS ALWAYS PRESENT, `[]` when nothing failed. The field was
# absent from every receipt gate.sh writes - so a reader saw `null`,

# packets carried `[]`. "Nothing failed" and "nobody wrote the field"

# `infra/gate.sh` writes a rich account of the run — mode, scope, head,
# dirty, host, ci, free_gb, unverifiable[], every check with its result
# and its duration, and `refused_because` when it declined. Each of
# those fields exists because some reader once had to go and re-derive
# it, and its own comment says so.
#
# This block used to REDUCE that to {verdict, head, mode, fails} before
# reporting, and the rest died on /gate-target with gate.log when the
# Job was reaped. Measured on a live gate-run packet (86553d4f): the
# receipt the packet kept was 101 characters. So `boss-jobs`' yard,
# which reads `receipt.checks` to name a red gate's failing check, found
# nothing to read; `dirty`, which train.rs refuses to board on, never
# arrived; and "which check was slow" was unanswerable from the record.
#
# §Diagnosis: a verdict someone must go re-derive is not a verdict. The
# whole receipt costs a few hundred bytes on the packet, which is the
# cheapest evidence in this pipeline.
#
# COMPACT, one line: `gate-runner: receipt $SUMMARY` below is the third
# copy of the verdict — the one `kubectl logs` serves when the PVC and
# the packet do not (cf0021ae) — and a greppable line has to stay one
# line. `fails` is not re-derived here either — the block above already
# merged it into the receipt this reads, and it is NOT a copy of `checks`:
# `checks` says which check failed, `fails` says which TEST and where it
# panicked, which is the part `checks` cannot carry and a reader acts on.
# A `fails` that merely restated the check names would be a fact living
# twice inside one document with nothing holding the two equal
# (CLAUDE.md §9a), which is why it does not.

# WHY THE FAILING OUTPUT IS REPLAYED TO STDOUT. gate.log is written to
# /gate-target, which only the gate container mounts — not the postgres
# sidecar, not any later Job. When this container exits, the last reader
# of that file is gone. So a failure that cost an hour to produce left a
# receipt naming WHICH check failed and no way whatsoever to learn WHY.
#
# That is not hypothetical: three branches were called red by this rig
# and then passed every one of those same checks run by hand, and no
# theory could be tested because the evidence died with the pod
# (backlog 9c7ed804). A verdict nobody can explain is barely better
# than no verdict — it teaches the reader to distrust the gate.
#
# stdout is the one surface that outlives the container: `kubectl logs`
# serves a terminated pod for as long as the Job exists. gate.sh already
# brackets every check with `::group::gate: <name>` / `::endgroup::`, so
# the failure-detail block above replays exactly the sections that failed
# and nothing else. That distinction is the whole point — a full gate.log
# is mostly successful build chatter and dumping it whole would bury the
# three lines that matter.
#
# THIS IS A PRINTER NOW, not a second parser. The extraction moved up to
# the one block that also writes the receipt's `fails`, because "what did
# the failed checks say" is one fact and it was about to live twice
# (CLAUDE.md §9a). Its `|| tail` belt remains for the case where that
# block did not run at all; every case it DID handle — an unreadable
# receipt, a verdict with no failed check — writes its own explanation
# plus the raw tail into the file, so the fallback says why it fired.

# REFRESH THE SEED — the housekeeping that keeps parallel gates warm.

#     still compile), but a compile-error red would seed broken
#     workspace artifacts, and telling the cases apart buys nothing:
#     green near-tip runs happen many times a day.
#   - AT/NEAR main's tip, measured not felt: every car gates as
#     main + one change, so `rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main` is 0
#     in the common case and small when a train merged mid-gate. Past
#     2 the branch is stale-based and its target would seed the
#     distance to main into every later gate.
#   - EXCLUSIVE, NON-BLOCKING lock. Readers hold the lock shared while
#     copying; a second refresher just skips (-n) — best-effort
#     housekeeping does not queue.
#   - STAGE THEN RENAME. The copy lands in target.partial and is
#     mv-ed into place; a pod that dies mid-refresh (w-1 has reset
#     mid-gate before) leaves a MISSING seed — next gate cold, slow,
