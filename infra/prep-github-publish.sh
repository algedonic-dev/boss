#!/usr/bin/env bash
# prep-github-publish.sh — measure what a push to the public GitHub
# mirror would actually publish, and prove it is safe to publish.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Shipping moved to the internal forge on 2026-08-12
# and the GitHub mirror silently stopped being fed. Nothing broke, so
# nothing announced it; the drift was found by asking. A protocol that
# measures the gap on a cadence turns "is the public mirror current?"
# into a query instead of a thing somebody remembers to wonder about.
#
# This script MEASURES AND REPORTS. It never pushes and never opens a
# PR. Publication is a human decision because the target is public and
# cannot be taken back — a force-push removes the commit but not what
# was already cloned, indexed, or mirrored.
#
# THE MIRROR IS FED BY PULL REQUEST, NOT BY PUSHING main (David,
# 2026-08-14: "We should be opening a PR"). That gives two independent
# gates: the protocol's sign-off before the branch is pushed, and the
# merge on GitHub afterwards. Note that on a public repo the PR itself
# is the publication event — a PR diff is world-readable the moment it
# opens — so the sign-off still sits BEFORE the push, not before the
# merge.
#
# THE MIRROR IS READ THROUGH A REMOTE NAMED `github`, read-only and
# anonymous — the repo is public, so measuring needs no credential
# anywhere. Add it once: `git remote add github https://github.com/algedonic-dev/boss.git`.
#
# THE MIRROR IS GUARDED BY CONTENT, NOT BY COMMIT IDENTITY. A mirror
# holding work nobody published must block: a snapshot pushed over it
# destroys that work. Until 2026-09-10 the test for it was commit
# identity — any commit in `SOURCE..TARGET` blocked — and that test was
# a false positive BY CONSTRUCTION, because the protocol manufactures
# exactly such commits: the snapshot is a `commit-tree` of the source
# ref's tree onto the mirror's main, and merging the PR adds GitHub's
# merge commit above it. Neither can ever appear on the source ref, so
# from the first successful publish onward the condition was permanently
# true and the protocol could never run again. Measured on 2026-09-10:
# the one "absent" commit was b178a534 "Publish: forge main through
# 2026-08-27 (#129) (#236)", whose tree 02a76d57 IS the tree of forge
# main's b78ae6d2 — identical content, nothing to lose — and it was
# refusing a publish of 238 commits / 763 files. A check its own success
# makes permanently true protects nothing.
#
# So the question asked is now the one worth asking — does the mirror
# hold file content the source history does not? — and it is asked of
# TREES, in infra/mirror-drift-lib.sh, which carries the rule and its
# boundary. `commits_behind` still counts every mirror-only commit;
# `commits_behind_foreign` counts the ones that changed a file, and only
# those block. A blocking finding names the commit and the files.
#
# A REF THAT DOES NOT RESOLVE IS A REFUSAL, NOT A MEASUREMENT. Until
# 2026-09-08 a SOURCE_REF or mirror ref that did not exist made every
# `git rev-list` fail silently under `|| echo 0`, and the script exited
# 0 with `has_drift:false` — "the mirror is current" — while the mirror
# was 211 commits behind (design 7b59af2c). On the protocol's measure
# step that is the number that closes the packet nothing-to-publish. A
# wrong target must error, not answer (CLAUDE.md §Doors), so both refs
# are verified first and a miss exits 2 naming the ref.
#
# Usage:  infra/prep-github-publish.sh [--json]
# Exit:   0 = safe to publish (or nothing to publish)
#         1 = a blocking finding; do not publish
#         2 = refused: a ref did not resolve; nothing was measured
