# ops-runner — answer ops-request packets filed against this host.
#
# The PULL half of host observability (packet 729329c6). David: "I am
# really tired of the copy pasting after sshing." A debug read is a
# packet: somebody files an `ops-request` Job naming a host and an
# allowlisted read-only verb; this runner, on that host under a
# ~1-minute systemd timer, polls the system of record, executes the
# verb, and completes the packet's `execute` step with stdout/stderr
# and the exit code. The operator stops being the transport.
#
# ## Security posture (phase 1)
#
# - READ-ONLY. Every verb in the allowlist is a read; mutating verbs
#   are phase 2, behind per-verb policy, and are NOT in this script's
#   world at all.
# - THE ALLOWLIST IS THE AUTHORITY: infra/ops/verbs.json, in-tree,
#   reviewed, versioned. A packet carries only a verb NAME and args;
#   the command words come from the file. The runner never executes a
#   packet-supplied string.
# - NO SHELL INTERPOLATION OF ARGS, EVER. The runner builds an argv
#   ARRAY (`set -- word word ...`) and execs it directly — no sh -c,
#   no eval, nothing packet-supplied ever becomes program text. Args
#   are validated against strict per-param patterns first (no
#   whitespace, no leading '-'), which is also what makes the
#   newline-split of jq's argv output below exact rather than hopeful.
# - A VERB SERVES NAMED HOSTS, and a host serves only the verbs that
#   name it: every allowlist entry declares `hosts` (estate node ids),
#   and a verb whose `hosts` does not list this runner's HOST_ID is
#   REFUSED — absent `hosts` included, so a new verb cannot reach a
#   host by forgetting to say. Not a privilege boundary (every runner
#   reads the same file) but a door that tells the truth about what it
#   opens: 11 of the 16 verbs name a script under the FORGE's checkout,
#   so when boss-gcp got a runner (2026-09-11) the unscoped allowlist
#   would have advertised a vocabulary of which 11 could only fail on
#   ENOENT. An exec failure is not a verdict; a refusal naming the
#   verb, this host and the hosts that verb does serve is.
# - Anything else — unknown verb, wrong arg shape, pattern miss —
#   drives the packet to its `refused` terminal with the reason in
#   `output` AND, named, in `reason` — the same text the journal line
#   carries, so a refusal never has to be re-derived from the host's
#   journal (6964f9e8; CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: a verdict must name what
#   failed). Refusing loudly in the SoR beats guessing.
# - A param may be a LITERAL LIST (`one_of`) instead of a pattern: the
#   packet selects one of the reviewed words in the allowlist, and
#   nothing packet-supplied reaches the argv — so a word there may
#   lead with '-' (publish-github-pr's `--check`). With `optional`,
#   an absent arg DROPS its placeholder word from the argv rather
#   than passing an empty one.
#
# ## Behaviour
#
# - Polls open ops-request Jobs whose metadata.host equals HOST_ID,
#   exactly. A packet for a host with no runner is nobody's to guess
#   at; it sits open and visibly unanswered.
# - Executes with a wall-clock timeout (OPS_TIMEOUT, default 30s) and
#   an output cap (OPS_OUTPUT_CAP, default 100KB); both truncations
#   are LOUD — a marker line in the recorded output says what was cut.
# - Completes the `execute` step with metadata MERGED, never replaced:
#   `PUT .../steps/{id}` swaps `metadata` wholesale, so sending only
#   new keys silently wipes the rest, including `authority_role`
#   (the boss-step.sh lesson).
# - A per-packet problem (refusal, missing step) never kills the loop;
#   a transport failure to the SoR fails the unit loudly, systemd
#   records it red, and the same loud-local-failure posture as the
#   estate observers applies (3ddd8333: silent-on-curl-failure does
#   not get a second landing).
# - No maintenance-wrap packet pair, deliberately: this fires every
#   minute, and a packet per firing would drown the board. Its
#   product IS packets — the ops-requests it answers — and its
#   failure modes are a red systemd unit plus a filed packet aging
#   visibly unanswered.
#
# ## Env
#
#   HOST_ID        (required) estate node id this runner answers for
#   BOSS_JOBS_URL  (required, no default — see below) the SoR
#   OPS_VERBS_FILE (default: verbs.json beside this script)
#   OPS_TIMEOUT    (default 30) seconds before a verb is killed, unless
#                  the verb's allowlist entry declares its own `timeout`
#   OPS_OUTPUT_CAP (default 102400) bytes of output kept
#   BOSS_MACHINE_TOKEN (optional) forwarded as x-boss-machine-token
#
# All JSON parsing is jq with payloads on stdin or via --arg/--argjson/
# --rawfile, never spliced into the program text (the boss-step.sh /
# feedback-queue.sh rule).
