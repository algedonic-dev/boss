# ops-runner — answer ops-request packets filed against this host.
#
# The PULL half of host observability (packet 729329c6). David: "I am
# really tired of the copy pasting after sshing." A debug read is a
# packet: somebody files an `ops-request` Job naming a host and an
# allowlisted read-only verb; this runner, on that host under a
# ~1-minute systemd timer, polls the system of record, executes the
# verb, and completes the packet's `execute` step with stdout/stderr
# and the exit code. The operator stops being the transport.
#
# ## Security posture (phase 1)
#
# - READ-ONLY. Every verb in the allowlist is a read; mutating verbs
#   are phase 2, behind per-verb policy, and are NOT in this script's
#   world at all.
# - THE ALLOWLIST IS THE AUTHORITY: infra/ops/verbs/<name>.json, one
#   file per verb, in-tree, reviewed, versioned (the verb's name IS
#   the file name; infra/ops/verbs-allowlist.sh assembles the
#   directory — 5086842d, after two verb cars collided on the one file
#   it used to be). A packet carries only a verb NAME and args; the
#   command words come from the file. The runner never executes a
#   packet-supplied string.
# - NO SHELL INTERPOLATION OF ARGS, EVER. The runner builds an argv
#   ARRAY (`set -- word word ...`) and execs it directly — no sh -c,
#   no eval, nothing packet-supplied ever becomes program text. Args
#   are validated against strict per-param patterns first (no
#   whitespace, no leading '-'), which is also what makes the
#   newline-split of jq's argv output below exact rather than hopeful.
# - A VERB SERVES NAMED HOSTS, and a host serves only the verbs that
#   name it: every allowlist entry declares `hosts` (estate node ids),
#   and a verb whose `hosts` does not list this runner's HOST_ID is
#   REFUSED — absent `hosts` included, so a new verb cannot reach a
#   host by forgetting to say. Not a privilege boundary (every runner
#   reads the same file) but a door that tells the truth about what it
#   opens: 11 of the 16 verbs name a script under the FORGE's checkout,
#   so when boss-gcp got a runner (2026-09-11) the unscoped allowlist
#   would have advertised a vocabulary of which 11 could only fail on
#   ENOENT. An exec failure is not a verdict; a refusal naming the
#   verb, this host and the hosts that verb does serve is.
# - Anything else — unknown verb, wrong arg shape, pattern miss —
#   drives the packet to its `refused` terminal with the reason in
#   `output` AND, named, in `reason` — the same text the journal line
#   carries, so a refusal never has to be re-derived from the host's
#   journal (6964f9e8; CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: a verdict must name what
#   failed). Refusing loudly in the SoR beats guessing.
# - A param may be a LITERAL LIST (`one_of`) instead of a pattern: the
#   packet selects one of the reviewed words in the allowlist, and
#   nothing packet-supplied reaches the argv — so a word there may
#   lead with '-' (publish-github-pr's `--check`). With `optional`,
#   an absent arg DROPS its placeholder word from the argv rather
#   than passing an empty one.
# - A VERB THAT DECLARES `requires_approval` RUNS ONLY UNDER A PASSKEY
#   APPROVAL OF A RENDERED PLAN (design 17835005, decided by David
#   2026-09-21; backlog fd7090cc). Until 2026-09-24 this runner refused
#   every such verb, because nothing issued an approval. Now, in order:
#   the verb names a read-only `plan_verb`, which this runner renders
#   on the host and writes onto the request's `approve` step; David's
#   passkey signs that step, and a presence stamp binds
#   `step_shape_hash(title, metadata)` — the plan bytes; `execute`
#   runs only once the approve step is COMPLETED with a presence stamp
#   for every required role, bound to the step's CURRENT shape, signed
#   within APPROVAL_TTL_S; `execute` is claimed `active` before the
#   argv runs, and an `active` one is never run again; and the write
#   gets sha256 of the SIGNED plan as its last param, `plan_sha256`, so
#   its own script re-renders and refuses a state that moved since the
#   signature. q2 as David ruled it: the runner trusts the system of
#   record's sign-off record and nothing else — a metadata flag, a
#   packet-supplied hash, a completed step with no stamp are all
#   refusals, each named on the request.
#   Tightened after the car's security review (2026-09-24): the stamp
#   must be by an employee the verb file names in `approvers` (design
#   03451237 q2 — a named list, not a role); the plan is signed with
#   the verb, host and args it was rendered for and the hash of the
#   bytes this runner rendered, and the request must still match them;
#   the plan verb is re-run before the claim and the signed plan must be
#   its bytes exactly; the record is re-read immediately before a claim
#   that is a compare-and-set through the claim door; an execute left
#   `active` records "claimed, outcome unknown" and is never called
#   refused; and an arg carrying a control character is refused.
#   And after its re-review (2026-09-25): only an UNHELD execute is
#   claimed — ops-request declares execute `claimable`, so the
#   dispatcher no longer nominates it to the agent executor, whose hold
#   the claim door would refuse this runner on — a held one is refused
#   by name, and "claimed, outcome unknown" names only a holder shaped
#   like one of this runner's own passes.
#
# ## Behaviour
#
# - Polls open ops-request Jobs whose metadata.host equals HOST_ID,
#   exactly. A packet for a host with no runner is nobody's to guess
#   at; it sits open and visibly unanswered.
# - READS ITS OWN QUEUE before it walks it — depth and the oldest
#   packet's wait — on one journal line per run, and writes what each
#   answered request waited onto that request. The walk is serial and
#   has no per-verb fairness, so this depth is the only real bound on
#   raising any probe cadence further (backlog 1ffb3305). The depth is
#   the server's `total` for this host, and a reading that could not
#   see the whole queue prints `>=` and `truncated:` instead of passing
#   a page off as the count (2cfb4562).
# - Executes with a wall-clock timeout (OPS_TIMEOUT, default 30s) and
#   an output cap (OPS_OUTPUT_CAP, default 100KB); both truncations
#   are LOUD — a marker line in the recorded output says what was cut.
# - Completes the `execute` step with metadata MERGED, never replaced:
#   `PUT .../steps/{id}` swaps `metadata` wholesale, so sending only
#   new keys silently wipes the rest, including `authority_role`
#   (the boss-step.sh lesson).
# - Records the verb's exit ONCE, as `exit_code` on that step.
#   `answered` means the verb ran; `exit_code` says how it went, and
#   every reader — `boss ops --wait`, the answered-ops-request judges,
#   the yard — takes it from there (50fede8b; see the merge door below
#   for the request-level copy this replaced).
# - Records how long the verb RAN, as `duration_ms` beside that exit
#   (b7bfe821). The request's own stamps span this runner's poll
#   latency — up to a minute — so they cannot cost a verb; this is
#   taken around the exec. A refusal ran nothing and records neither.
# - A per-packet problem (refusal, missing step) never kills the loop;
#   a transport failure to the SoR fails the unit loudly, systemd
#   records it red, and the same loud-local-failure posture as the
#   estate observers applies (3ddd8333: silent-on-curl-failure does
#   not get a second landing).
# - A completion the SERVER REFUSES is written onto the request as
#   `completion_refused` (status, the server's words, first/last,
#   count, whether the verb ran), so a jammed packet names its own
#   cause (post-mortem 3c3b202c: two hours of 409s that only a journal
#   ever saw, and only as a number).
# - No maintenance-wrap packet pair, deliberately: this fires every
#   minute, and a packet per firing would drown the board. Its
#   product IS packets — the ops-requests it answers — and its
#   failure modes are a red systemd unit plus a filed packet aging
#   visibly unanswered.
#

#   OPS_TIMEOUT    (default 30) seconds before a verb is killed, unless
#                  the verb's allowlist entry declares its own `timeout`
#   OPS_OUTPUT_CAP (default 102400) bytes of output kept
#   BOSS_MACHINE_TOKEN (optional) forwarded as x-boss-machine-token

# THE READING, TAKEN BEFORE THE WALK (backlog 1ffb3305). This loop is
# serial and has no per-verb fairness: a latency-sensitive verb waits
# behind whatever is ahead of it in the same run, so a converge — the
# verb that deploys a fix — waits behind however many run-car-probes
# are in front of it. Measured 2026-09-19: run-car-probe was 171 of
# the last 300 ops-requests against 42 converges, and its cadence went
# daily to hourly the same day. Today's volumes are comfortable and
# that is the point of measuring now: the depth is the only real bound
# on raising a probe cadence further, and a queue whose depth nobody
# reads is one that gets discovered at its worst moment, by a converge
# that did not deploy when it should have. Per-verb fairness or a
# priority lane is the larger change and waits for this reading to say
# it is needed.

    # execute is claimed `active` BEFORE its argv runs, and an `active`
    # one is never run again (it is "claimed, outcome unknown" above), so
    # a second pass — this runner's next minute, or a second runner —
    # can never run the same approval twice, whether or not this one
    # finishes. A claim the server does not take runs nothing: the next
    # pass sees a ready step and judges the approval again, window
    # included.
    #
    # Two things make that true rather than hoped (security review,
    # 2026-09-24):
    #
    # - THE RECORD IS READ AGAIN IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE CLAIM. The list
    #   this pass judged was read at its top, and the plan re-render
    #   above takes seconds; another pass may have claimed execute, or
    #   the sign-off may have been withdrawn, since. The one job is read
    #   again and judged again, and a record that moved is left for the
    #   next pass with nothing written — a stale read decides nothing.
    # - THE CLAIM IS A COMPARE-AND-SET. It was a PUT of
    #   {"status":"active"}, which the server overlays on whatever the
    #   step is, so two passes that both read `ready` both "claimed". It
    #   goes through the claim door, whose WHERE clause admits exactly
    #   one ready->active. That door is idempotent for its HOLDER, so the
    #   claim is signed as a claimant unique to this pass — the runner's
    #   account, its host, the pass — and a second pass is a second
    #   claimant, which the door refuses 409 naming the holder.

    # (`step has unresolved blockers`, the ops-request v2 `approve`
    # step; fixed in bd0f3369). The journal held "409" and nothing else,
    # the red unit had no reader, and the verbs re-ran once a minute for
    # two hours. So the status and the server's words are kept. A
    # refusal (the server answered, and not 2xx) is also written onto
    # the request through the metadata door, which kept working all
    # night: the packet then says why it is stuck. A transport failure
    # (no answer at all) has no words to keep and no door to write
    # through, so it stays a journal line and a red unit, as before.

    # where it used to answer success and erase that write. That refusal
    # means NOTHING was written, and the handler reads the row afresh on
    # a resend, so the same body goes once more: it is exactly the write
    # that would have been accepted had it arrived a moment later — and
    # the omitted-keys refusal still stands between it and a key the
    # other write added. Before this the one 409 recorded
