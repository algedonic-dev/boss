# observe-lib — post an observation, or keep it until the system of
# record can take it. Sourced by observe-host.sh; exercised under stubs
# by infra/lint/the-observer-retains-and-replays.sh on every gate.
#
# WHY. The estate observers report THROUGH the jobs API, so when the
# system of record is down they are silent about an outage — and the
# series simply has a hole nobody can tell from "the timer did not
# fire" (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: an alarm that reports through its
# subject dies with it; packet ec50db46). Retaining what was observed
# and replaying it once the API answers makes the gap VISIBLE
# afterwards: the replayed readings carry their original observed_at,
# so the series shows the outage as readings that arrived late, not as
# readings that never were. The operator channel for the outage
# itself is a separate decision; this half needs none.
#
# Spool: one file per observation, named by observed_at, under
# SPOOL_DIR (default /var/tmp/boss-estate-spool — persists across
# reboots, writable by any unit user). Replay is oldest first and stops
# at the first failure, keeping the rest. The spool is capped: past
# SPOOL_MAX files (default 200 — fifty hours at the 15-minute cadence)
# the oldest is dropped, so a long outage cannot fill a disk that is
# probably the thing being observed.
#
# POSIX sh + curl only (directive 26d61c97: no python on hosts); the
# one field this file reads out of a reading, observed_at, is read
# with sed so the spool needs nothing the observer does not.

# THESE TWO LINES ARE THE DEFINITION FOR BOTH HALVES of this mechanism.
# The Rust stage downstream of this observer (`estate.compare`, packet
# 6bf34846) retains and replays the same way, into the same spool, under
# the same cap — and derives both values from HERE at build time rather
# than restating them (CLAUDE.md §9a: prefer collapsing;
# crates/orchestrators/boss-dispatcher-handlers/build.rs). It parses
# exactly this `NAME="${NAME:-VALUE}"` idiom and fails the build, naming
# the variable, if it stops finding it. Change the value freely; keep
# the shape, or move the definition on purpose.
