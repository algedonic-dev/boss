# boss — the BOSS CLI on a managed host, as installed by its converge
# (boss-gcp-converge on boss-gcp; forge-converge's install.sh on the
# forge, for the cluster-operator role — backlog 9f00a805).
#
# This file is copied to <store>/boss (the store is /opt/boss-cli on the
# host) and /usr/local/bin/boss is a symlink to it. It execs the CLI of
# the generation `current` points at, and it exists for ONE reason: the
# binary in the cluster image is compiled with BOSS_CLI_BUILT_FROM=unknown
# (no git in the build stage, and no BOSS_BUILD_COMMIT at compile time
# since 2026-09-12, so a train without a Rust change ships without a
# Rust build) and reads BOSS_BUILD_COMMIT at RUNTIME instead
# (crates/orchestrators/boss-cli/src/built_from.rs). A binary copied out
# of the image and run bare says `built from unknown`, and every host
# verb that shells to the CLI refuses that by name (publish-workflow's
# floor check, exit 78 — backlog 6f58e9a1). So the wrapper supplies the
# commit, and it supplies it from the ONE place the sha is defined: the
# generation directory's name, which install-cli-from-image.sh created
# for exactly that sha and confirmed through this wrapper before linking
# `current` at it. Nothing else carries the sha — no sidecar file, no
# text baked into this script — so nothing can disagree with it
# (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#
# Resolved relative to THIS file's real location, the way the pod's
# infra/dev/boss reads its sor-url: /usr/local/bin/boss is a symlink
# here, and readlink -f follows it to the store.
#
# It does not default BOSS_JOBS_URL: every unit on a managed host reads
# the system of record from /etc/boss/sor.env with EnvironmentFile=
# (the ops runner's included, so a verb it runs inherits the address),
# and a default here would be a second spelling of the system of record
# that could point at the wrong one — on boss-gcp, 127.0.0.1 was the
# legacy second stack. A bare `boss` verb with no BOSS_JOBS_URL refuses
# and names the fix, which is right.
