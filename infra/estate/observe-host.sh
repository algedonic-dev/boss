# observe-host — the estate observation loop, for hosts the cluster
# observer cannot see.
#
# boss-estate-observe (CronJob) covers scope kubernetes-nodes. The two
# non-cluster machines — the conductor VM and the forge host — had no
# observed series at all: boss-gcp's own registry note reads "48GB is
# the smallest disk in the estate and nothing watches it", and the
# 2026-08-30 disk-headroom sweep measured both BY HAND, which is what
# spawned the class car this script answers (a5d14977, sweep 3ff8f240).
#
# Same design as the cluster observer, deliberately: observe and POST,
# never write the registry (declared vs observed stay apart, or nothing
# can be found missing); capacity rounds to nearest GiB — THE one
# stated rounding rule; free space is observed state, so it rides the
# event, not a column. sh + jq, no python (directive 26d61c97).
#
# Env: HOST_ID (required — must match the estate node row id),
#      JOBS_API (required), ADDRESS (optional; default: first global IP).
#
# A failed POST fails LOUDLY with the target named — the cluster
# observer shipped silent-on-curl-failure once (3ddd8333) and that
# class does not get a second landing. And it is RETAINED: the reading
# is spooled and replayed, oldest first, on the next run that reaches
# the API, so an outage of the system of record shows in the series as
# readings that arrived late rather than as a hole (observe-lib.sh,
# packet ec50db46).
