#
# undeclared-objects.sh — WHAT IS RUNNING THAT THE TREE DOES NOT DECLARE.
# One definition of that question, for every reader of it.
#
# WHY IT IS ITS OWN SCRIPT
# -----------------------
# The converge runs `kubectl apply -f infra/cluster/manifests` with NO
# `--prune`. Apply is additive: it creates and updates what the files
# name and has no opinion about anything else. So deleting a manifest
# removes the DECLARATION and leaves the OBJECT running, forever, with
# nothing in the tree accounting for it. `check-manifests-applied.sh`
# is the observer for the other direction — "is everything declared
# present?" — a question a deleted file is not in.
#
# Two programs want the answer to this one:
#
#   * the orphan LINT, which reports it so a human is told; and
#   * the `delete-orphan-object` ops verb
#     (infra/forge/delete-orphan-object.sh), which DERIVES ITS
#     AUTHORITY from it — it may delete a named object only if this
#     computation names that object.
#
# Two programs computing "what is orphaned" is exactly the defect
# CLAUDE.md §9a describes, and here it would be worse than drift: the
# verb's bound IS the computation, so a second copy of it is a second,
# unreviewed bound. Hence one script, three ways to ask it.
#
# THE SCOPE, STATED RATHER THAN ASSUMED
# -------------------------------------
# "Undeclared" is only well posed where the tree's declaration set is
# complete enough to compare against, so a (kind, namespace) pair is IN
# SCOPE when
#   * the namespace is one the tree OWNS — $DIR declares a `Namespace`
#     object for it (today: boss, boss-dev); and
#   * $DIR declares at least one object of that kind in it; and
#   * the kind is not in $EXCLUDED_KINDS below.
#
# OUT OF SCOPE, each for a stated reason — never silently skipped:
#   * CLUSTER-SCOPED KINDS (ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, Namespace,
#     StorageClass). The cluster holds hundreds that belong to Talos,
#     Cilium, cert-manager and Longhorn; the tree declares four.
#     Sweeping them would report the cluster's own furniture as BOSS's
#     orphans.
#   * NAMESPACES THE TREE DOES NOT OWN. `boss-tls.yaml` puts two
#     one-shot Jobs into `cert-manager`, which cert-manager owns and
#     fills with its own work. "The tree declares something here" is
#     not "the tree manages this namespace".
#   * KINDS THE TREE DECLARES NOTHING OF in that namespace — Pod,
#     ReplicaSet, Endpoints, EndpointSlice, ControllerRevision, Event.
#     There is no declared set to compare them against, so every one of
#     them would be a finding.
#   * OBJECTS WITH AN ownerReference. A controller made them from a
#     declared parent (Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> Pod, CronJob -> Job);
#     deleting the parent's manifest is the declared change and the
#     children follow.
#   * $EXCLUDED_KINDS and $EXEMPT below, each entry carrying its reason.
#
# A PARTIAL SCRAPE IS AN ERROR, NOT A SMALLER ANSWER. If a manifest
# fails to parse, every object it declares falls out of the declared set
# and looks undeclared — and for the verb that would mean deleting a
# DECLARED object. So a file `kubectl` cannot parse, a directory with
# implausibly few manifests, or a credential that cannot list a pair
# makes this script say "cannot answer" and exit 4. "Could not look" is
# never rounded to "nothing to report" (CLAUDE.md §Doors: a wrong
# target answers instead of erroring).
#
# CANNOT ANSWER HAS AN EXIT CODE OF ITS OWN (4), and that is the whole
# point of it. In `--list` a clean cluster and a cluster full of orphans
# BOTH exit 0 — the answer is on stdout, not in the status — so a
# consumer that reads only `-ne 0` cannot tell a refusal from a finding,
# and one that reads only `-eq 0` reads a refusal as "clean". Neither
# mistake is available once the refusal has its own number. 1 stays what
# it was for: this run asked nothing well posed (a bad mode, a missing
# argument). Every code other than 0 and 3 was already CANNOT ANSWER to
# the ops verb, so this sharpens the contract rather than breaking it.
#
# USAGE
#   undeclared-objects.sh --list
#       kind<TAB>ns<TAB>name for every in-scope live object no manifest
#       declares. Coverage notes on stderr. This is the orphan set.
#       exit 0 — answered; stdout IS the set, empty when there are none
#       exit 4 — cannot answer; stdout is empty and the reason is named
#   undeclared-objects.sh --check <Kind>/<namespace>/<name>
#       exit 0 — undeclared; prints `undeclared<TAB>kind<TAB>ns<TAB>name`
#       exit 3 — NO, with the test that refused it named on stderr
#       exit 4 — cannot answer, with the reason named
#   undeclared-objects.sh --declared
#       kind<TAB>ns<TAB>name<TAB>file for everything the tree declares.
#       exit 4 when any manifest would not parse: a declared set missing
#       a file is not a smaller declared set, it is no answer.
#   undeclared-objects.sh --exemptions
#       the exemption entries, as `Kind/ns/name` or `Kind/name`.
#   undeclared-objects.sh --kubectl
#       the resolved kubectl argv, so a caller needing its own kubectl
#       call uses the same one rather than a second resolution.
#   exit 1 in any mode — a usage error. Nothing was computed.
#
# ENV
#   BOSS_CLUSTER_TREE  the tree to read manifests from (default: the
#                      repository this script lives in). A test seam,
#                      and the reason the fixtures in
#                      boss-testing/tests/delete_orphan_object_sh.rs can
#                      exercise this without a cluster. A packet cannot
#                      set it: the ops-runner passes no environment from
#                      the packet, only an argv built from the
#                      allowlist.
#   BOSS_KUBECTL       the kubectl command, whitespace-separated words
#                      (default: `kubectl`, else a docker wrapper —
#                      see resolve_kubectl).
#   KUBECONFIG         a credential that can read the managed
#                      namespaces. The converge's admin kubeconfig can;
#                      the dev pod's session credential reads only part
#                      of it and the unreadable part is NAMED.
