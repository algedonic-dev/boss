#       sixth column is the NAMESPACE of the instance this one copies
#       its shared Secrets from (`shares_with` in instances.toml; backlog
#       dc1bc724), empty when it declares none. The third is the
#       DIRECTORY the pod reads under /opt/boss (`tenant_dir`, or the
#       literal `tenant` for a repo-sourced instance); the seventh and
#       eighth are `tenant_repo` and `tenant_ref`, empty for an
#       image-sourced one (backlog f4f5c387); the ninth is the SITE
#       hostname (`site`; design b64c4377), empty for an instance
#       without one — every reader keeps an empty column in place
#       (cluster-deploy-lib.sh instance_rows)
#   render-instance.sh --source        the source instance's namespace (the

#
# WHY (backlog 07d7549c car 1; design ffc83387, decided by David
# 2026-09-16). playground.algedonic.dev is a SECOND NAMESPACE on the
# current cluster, and both prod (namespace boss) and the playground
# converge on every train. Every manifest under infra/cluster/manifests/
# hard-codes `namespace: boss`, one tenant path, BOSS_SIM_ENABLED=false
# and one public hostname. A second namespace as a second copy of the
# YAML is the pair CLAUDE.md §9a bans — twenty-one files that would
# drift on the first car that edits one directory and not the other.
#
# So the directory stays the ONE source, written for exactly one
# instance (`source` in infra/cluster/instances.toml — prod), and any
# other instance is that directory with four values substituted for the
# source's — the idiom `manifests_with_image` in
# infra/forge/cluster-deploy-lib.sh already uses to put the converged
# image sha into the applied copy. Rendering the source instance is the
# identity by construction, and crates/core/boss-testing/tests/
# render_instance_sh.rs holds the prod render BYTE-IDENTICAL to the
# directory: landing this changed nothing live.
#
# WHAT IS SUBSTITUTED, for an instance other than the source:
#   * `namespace: <source>` on every object, and the Namespace object's
#     own name;
#   * `.<source>.svc.cluster.local` — the in-cluster DNS names by which
#     the chores reach the instance's jobs door and the tunnel connector
#     reaches the instance's gateway;
#   * the tenant directory under /opt/boss/ — BOSS_TENANT_DIR on the boss
#     container (backlog f4f5c387): /opt/boss/<tenant_dir> for a
#     directory the image ships, /opt/boss/tenant for a `tenant_repo`
#     the converge delivers as a ConfigMap (instances.toml says how);
#   * the BOSS_SIM_ENABLED value;
#   * the BOSS_GUEST_ACCESS value — `guest = true|false` in
#     instances.toml, rendered "1"|"0", the two spellings the gateway
#     reads (backlog 0d2d7daa, 2026-09-16: anonymous read-only sessions
#     are right for the public example and wrong for the operating
#     company's site, so each instance says);
#   * the public hostname (BOSS_PUBLIC_URL — since 21c17ebc, 2026-09-17,
#     there is no TLS front: Cloudflare terminates TLS at the edge and
#     the tunnel proxies to the gateway), everywhere the source's appears;
#   * the SITE hostname — BOSS_SITE_HOST on the boss container (design
#     b64c4377): the instance's `site`, or `""` for an instance that
#     declares none, which the gateway reads as "no site". Nothing
#     else about the site is substituted: BOSS_SITE_DIR and the
#     optional boss-site mount are the same for every instance, and an
#     instance without a site simply has an empty mount;
#   * and the LoadBalancer IP pins (io.cilium/lb-ipam-ips,
#     metallb.universe.tf/loadBalancerIPs, spec.loadBalancerIP) are
#     COMMENTED OUT — only one Service on the LAN can hold an address,
#     the source's copy holds it, and the pool assigns the rest.
#     Commented rather than deleted so the rendered file still says what
#     prod holds.
#
# WHICH MANIFESTS. infra/cluster/instance-manifests.txt classifies every
# file in the directory as `instance` (rendered per instance) or
# `pipeline` (applied once, as written, in the source's namespace set:
# the conductor, the dev pod, the gate seed, and the instance-shaped
# objects pinned to prod for the reason on their line). A file the
# roster does not classify, a roster line with no file, or a file in
# both sets is REFUSED by name before anything is rendered: a partial
# render reads as a full one.
#
# REFUSALS (exit 2, nothing rendered, the reason on stderr):
#   * a namespace that is not `boss` or `boss-<name>` — or is boss-dev,
#     the pipeline's;
#   * a tenant directory that is not examples/<name> (or `tenant`, the
#     delivered mount), or holds no tenant.toml / seeds/tenant.toml; an
#     instance declaring both `tenant_dir` and `tenant_repo`, neither,
#     a repo without a ref or a ref without a repo, a repo that is not
#     `owner/name` — or the RETIRED `tenant = "<manifest path>"` key,
#     which must not read as "no source";
#   * a sim value that is not true or false; a guest value that is not
#     true or false (or is missing — silence must not read as "guests
#     may read"); a hostname that is not one;
#   * a site that is not a hostname, that equals any instance's
#     hostname or another instance's site (one name, two routes), or
#     that is declared on an image-sourced instance — the converge
#     stages a site from a tenant CHECKOUT, so a site needs tenant_repo;
#   * a `shares_with` that names no instance in the file, or the
#     instance itself — the converge copies shared Secrets from the
#     namespace this resolves to, and an unknown source must not read
#     as "shares with nobody";
#   * a roster that does not match the directory (above);
#   * a SOURCE value the instance manifests do not carry. The source's
#     values in instances.toml must be what the files say; a prod entry
#     that drifted (www while the files still say boss) would turn every
#     other instance's substitution into a no-op that answers instead of
#     erroring — the class of failure CLAUDE.md §Doors ends on.
