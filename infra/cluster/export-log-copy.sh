# The migration IS a copy of the log — the executable form of
# docs/design/dev-cluster.md §"The migration is a copy of the log".
#
# Produces a restore-ready tarball of everything that does NOT
# regenerate from `git clone` + `migrate.sh` + `boss-rebuild-all`:
#
#   - audit_log            — the system of record; self-verifying (the
#                            hash chain travels with the rows, so the
#                            integrity check green on the DESTINATION
#                            proves the copy faithful end to end)
#   - workflows, step_plugins, classes, policy_rules,
#     policy_rule_audit, dispatcher_rules
#                          — authored registry tables with no rebuilder
#                            (workflow publishes land in the log but
#                            nothing consumes them; classes writes are
#                            eventless today)
#   - design_pending_decisions, design_flush_jobs
#                          — non-event-sourced by design
#   - sim_clock            — the epoch baseline row; its audit-id
#                            references copy verbatim with audit_log
#   - messages_events      — the messages retention log (history beyond
#                            the rebuilt projection; the operator inbox
#                            is real operational record now)
#   - /var/lib/boss/auth/credentials.toml
#                          — the one file outside both git and Postgres
#
# Seed-only tables (job_edges, the migration-shipped dispatcher rule
# rows, …) are deliberately absent: migrate.sh recreates them from the
# schema files on the destination.
#
# Procedure (the doc's, verbatim): quiesce writers, drain the outbox
# to verified-empty (outbox rows are pre-log — dumping around a
# non-empty outbox loses staged events), chain-check the source, dump,
# restart writers. Restore on the destination is:
#   git clone && migrate.sh from empty
#   psql < copy-set dumps
#   boss-rebuild-all && boss-audit-integrity-check   # must be green
#   deploy-services + deploy-web
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./infra/cluster/export-log-copy.sh --check   # preconditions only
#   sudo ./infra/cluster/export-log-copy.sh           # full export
