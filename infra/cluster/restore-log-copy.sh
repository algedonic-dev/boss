# Restore side of migration-as-log-copy — the counterpart of
# export-log-copy.sh, and the executable form of dev-cluster.md's
# restore sequence:
#
#   migrate.sh from empty → restore the copy-set → boss-rebuild-all →
#   boss-audit-integrity-check green → deploy-services + deploy-web
#
# This script owns everything up to (not including) the deploys. It is
# deliberately shape-independent: all it needs is a Postgres it may
# create a database on, the repo checkout it lives in, and the release
# binaries built (`infra/build-release.sh`).
#
# Two details the first rehearsal surfaced, encoded here so migration
# night does not rediscover them:
#
#   1. The migrations SEED part of the copy-set (dispatcher_rules
#      rows, platform classes …). The tarball carries the
#      authoritative copy, so the copy-set tables are TRUNCATEd after
#      migrate and before restore — the manifest counts then must
#      match exactly, seeds included, because the source ran the same
#      migrations.
#   2. credentials.toml is NOT installed by default. A rehearsal must
#      never touch /var/lib/boss/auth; pass --install-credentials on
#      the real move.
#
# The verification is three-fold and all three must pass: the chain
# integrity check (proves the audit_log copy faithful end to end),
# per-table row counts against the tarball's manifest (proves nothing
# was dropped or doubled), and the rebuild completing (proves the
# projections reproduce from the copied log).
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./infra/cluster/restore-log-copy.sh <tarball> --db <name> [--install-credentials]
#
# The target database must NOT exist — this restores into a fresh
# database only, and refuses to overwrite one it did not create.
