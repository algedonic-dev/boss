# Is what's in the tree what's running in the cluster?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `boss-dev.yaml` was merged on train 36 (2026-08-15)
# and applied by hand from a laptop. Nothing recorded that it had been
# applied, and nothing would have said if it hadn't. A day later a
# design doc asserted — in writing, to David — that the dev pod had
# never run, while it was sitting there with 25 hours of uptime and a
# bound 40 Gi volume. The reasoning was "no script applies it and no
# reachable host has kubectl, therefore nobody has one", which was
# sound and wrong.
#
# `deploy-services.sh` owns systemd units on boss-gcp. Nothing owned
# `infra/cluster/manifests/`, so "merged" and "running" were different
# states with no observer. This is the observer.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS. Every named object in every manifest exists in the
# cluster — and for the kinds where a present-but-WRONG object is the
# realistic failure, that its contents match too.
#
# ONE DIRECTION ONLY, and the other one has its own observer. This walks
# the TREE and asks "is each declared object present?". A manifest that
# was DELETED is not in that walk at all, and the object it left behind
# answers the question correctly by being absent from it — so this script
# is structurally blind to an orphan, and the converge's `kubectl apply`
# has no `--prune` to remove one. That direction is
# infra/lint/a-deleted-manifest-leaves-no-object.sh, which the converge
# runs immediately after this one.
#
# EXISTENCE WAS NOT ENOUGH, measured (95f6aba5). The dev-session Role
# was granted batch/jobs create,get,list,watch by hand on 2026-08-28 to
# close a car, and proven by launching a real gate. The grant was never
# written into boss-dev-access.yaml, so the next converge removed it and
# `boss gate` started failing with `jobs.batch is forbidden`. The Role
# EXISTED throughout; only its rules differed, so this check was green
# across the whole window in which the capability it guards silently
# went away.
#
# Note the direction, because it is the interesting part: the cluster
# had MORE than the tree, and the convergence was CORRECT — it removed
# an undeclared grant. The defect was that nothing could see a live
# capability resting on undeclared state, so a `proven in prod` claim
# was true and load-bearing on something with no owner.
#
# So RBAC objects are compared by content: `rules` for Roles, and
# `roleRef` + `subjects` for bindings. A missing rule is invisible and a
# spurious one is a privilege the tree never granted; both now fail.
# Other kinds stay existence-only — a full drift diff is `kubectl diff`
# and needs write-shaped permission this credential does not have.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  every object present, and every RBAC object matches the tree
#   1  something in the tree is not in the cluster, or differs from it
#   2  cannot reach the cluster (no credential, no kubectl) — NOT
#      confused with "nothing is applied", because reporting a missing
#      credential as missing infrastructure is the same class of error
#      this script was written about.
#
# RUN IT with a credential that can read the namespaces in question.
# The boss-dev session credential is namespace-scoped and cannot read
# cluster-scoped objects (Namespace, StorageClass) — those are
# reported as skipped rather than passed, so a narrow credential
# cannot produce a falsely green run.
