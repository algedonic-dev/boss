# publish-workflow — put the tree's row for one platform workflow kind
# live in the registry, from the converged checkout on boss-gcp, with
# the refusals that make it safe to hand to a button.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (backlog 3ce95b85, car 3a of 8f4e9cc0)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# A change to an EXISTING platform workflow kind goes live only when an
# operator runs `boss workflow publish <kind> <toml>` on a host with the
# checkout — the seed is insert-if-missing by decision. That publish is
# the one act that lands a data car for an existing kind, and until this
# verb it had no door but an operator's terminal: the daily drift
# measurement (19dec171) and the Drift tab (#378) show the drift and
# offer nothing, because the server has no tree. CLAUDE.md §Doors: an
# ops verb is a path made safe — correct target, correct actor,
# pre-approved. David, 2026-09-11: "We might need some sort of doc diff
# view for me to approve." This is the publish that approve fires.
#
# Measured while building it, 2026-09-15, against the system of record:
# sixteen `maintenance-*` kinds carry a `failed` step in the tree that
# the live row lacks — landed on 2026-09-08, never published — while
# `ship-a-change`'s live v31 carries `procedure` texts and a required
# `proof` field that no revision of the tree ever said, so publishing
# the tree over it would REGRESS the protocol. A publish verb that
# cannot tell those two apart is a footgun with a button on it.
#
# THE RULE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The live row is safe to overwrite iff it is a row THE TREE ONCE SAID:
# some revision of the bundle under infra/platform/ renders to the same
# label, description, category, subject_kinds and steps (title, kind,
# ready_when, title_template, authority_role, metadata_defaults, and
# each field's name/type/required). Then the tree moved ahead and live
# lags — publish. Otherwise the live row carries an edit the tree lacks:
# REFUSE, name the drift field by field, and publish only when the
# request says `--force-tree`. The walk covers the bundle DIRECTORY's
# history, not one file's, because the bundle was one file until
# 2026-09-08 and `git log --follow` cannot trace a split — the sixteen
# lagging rows match the OLD `workflows.toml`, not any revision of their
# own file (measured: design-doc matched its own file's first revision,
# maintenance-views-catchup matched 8cc7a03e:infra/platform/workflows.toml,
# pr-train and ship-a-change matched nothing).
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT COMPARE, and why that is not a hole: metadata_schema,
# entitlements, the workflow-level `metadata`, sign_offs_required. They
# are part of the row `boss workflow publish` sends, so they GO LIVE
# with a publish; they are left out of the equality only, so a tree that
# changed nothing but those reads as "nothing to publish" — and
# `--force-tree` publishes anyway, saying so. Widening the view is one
# edit to `row_view` below.
#
# THE SEQUENCE, each step checked rather than assumed
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. the kind's file exists in the tree               else exit 3
#   1b. the host's CLI can read a bundle: `boss --version` names a
#      commit at or after the loader's arrival (the floor) else exit 78
#   2. the live active row is read                       else exit 75 / 8
#   3. tree vs live: equal is nothing to publish         else exit 5
#      differing: the history walk decides; a live row the tree never
#      said is refused unless --force-tree               else exit 6
#   4. `boss workflow publish <kind> <file> --dry-run` lints the row and
#      refuses a dirty registry (a stale draft)          else exit 4
#   5. --check stops here, exit 0, saying what it would do
#   6. `boss workflow publish <kind> <file>` — the CLI's own checked
#      sequence: create the draft, read it back, publish, confirm
#   7. the live row is read back and compared to the tree AGAIN; the
#      version must have moved and the view must be equal   else exit 7
#
# The binary is the CLI's — the TOML is read by `boss_jobs::seed_loader`,
# the same loader the seed uses, so the row this publishes and the row
# a fresh database seeds are one definition (§9a); a shell re-derivation
# of that loader would be a second copy of it. The binary on boss-gcp is
# the one boss-gcp-converge installs at /usr/local/bin/boss out of the
# cluster image (infra/estate/install-cli-from-image.sh); a missing one is
# a configuration refusal naming that, never an ENOENT dressed as a
# verdict.
#
# AND A STALE ONE IS REFUSED BY NAME (backlog fec2851f). The first live
# run (ops-request 25cb2f71, 2026-09-15 16:36Z) reached step 4 with a
# host CLI older than the loader: it rejected the kind file as "is not
# JSON" — the branch an older `load_spec` falls into for any path —
# and this script reported exit 4, "the tree's file does not lint
# clean", about a file that lints clean. Nothing refreshed that binary
# then (boss-gcp-converge installed units only; `prod` is a deliberate
# human run), so the misnamed refusal would have sent an operator to
# the tree every time. Since 6f58e9a1 the converge installs the CLI
# from the cluster image at the sha it converged to and records
# `cli_sha` / `cli_result` on its packet, so the refresh path the
# refusal names is a packet read. `boss --version` is read first: the commit it
# names must sit in this checkout's history at or after CLI_FLOOR —
# the train that taught the CLI to read a bundle — else the refusal
# names the binary, its commit, the floor and the refresh path, as a
# host-configuration fault (78, where "no boss CLI" lives). A binary
# that cannot say (`unknown`) or names a commit this checkout does not
# hold is refused the same way: unplaceable is not assumed current.
