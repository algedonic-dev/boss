# retire-second-stack — stop and disable the second, older BOSS stack on
# boss-gcp: exactly the units infra/gcp/second-stack-units.txt names,
# after capturing the database they share, and nothing else, ever.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (design 9e3e093f, decided by David 2026-09-11; backlog
# d5941ef3 car 2)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# boss-gcp is the WireGuard bastion, the off-cluster observer and the ML
# batch host. It ALSO still runs a complete older BOSS stack — 32
# services against a database at 127.0.0.1 that is not the system of
# record, one of them (boss-docs-api) serving a crate deleted from the
# tree — plus the ten `legacy-stack` chores that maintain that stack's
# data, six of them red for three weeks. A unit installed and never
# serving is worse than absent: it reports failed forever and trains
# the operator to discount the alarm. David: "retire it quickly ...
# this is really part of our tech debt payoff."
#
# Retiring it by hand is 54 systemctl invocations on a console, with
# nothing recording which, in what order, or what the database held the
# moment before. So it is an ops verb through the audited door
# (infra/ops/verbs/retire-second-stack.json), and this script is its
# whole mechanism.
#
# THE BOUNDS, in the order they are applied — each refuses loudly and
# names the unit or the bound:
#
#   1. THE MODE. Exactly one argument, `--dry-run` or `--for-real`. The
#      allowlist admits only those two literals; the script re-checks
#      rather than relying on one layer (the delete-orphan-object
#      convention).
#   2. THE LIST. infra/gcp/second-stack-units.txt, read from the checkout
#      this script lives in. Every line is `boss-<name>.timer` or
#      `boss-<name>.service` — any other shape is refused BY NAME, which
#      puts the tunnel, the journal gateway, caddy and postgres out of
#      reach by construction. A duplicate is refused.
#   3. THE KEEP SET. The host's own loops (below) are never stopped, and
#      a list that names one is refused by name — a list that asks this
#      verb to stop the door it arrives through is a list nobody
#      reviewed.
#   4. THE SNAPSHOT. `systemctl list-units --all 'boss-*'` is printed in
#      full, so the packet holds what was running before anything moved.
#      The plan is the list ∩ the units present, in the list's order;
#      a listed unit the host does not have is reported and skipped.
#   5. THE ROLE. The real run refuses while the estate registry still
#      says boss-gcp declares `legacy-stack`: boss-gcp-converge installs
#      and enables that role's timers on every tick, so a stop now would
#      be reverted within half an hour and the record would lie. Read
#      through infra/estate/node-roles.sh, the same reader the converge
#      uses. A registry that cannot be read is a bound that cannot be
#      evaluated, which is a refusal — never a pass.
#   6. CAPTURE BEFORE STOP. `pg_dump` of the stack's database — found by
#      reading BOSS_POSTGRES_URL off the stack's own unit definitions
#      (`systemctl show -p Environment`), never hardcoded here — to a
#      dated file under /var/backups/boss/second-stack/. The credential
#      is passed to pg_dump and REDACTED everywhere it is printed. If
#      the capture fails, nothing is stopped: a stopped stack whose
#      final state was not recorded is one nobody can restore.
#
# `--dry-run` runs every bound, prints the plan (`would stop+disable
# <unit>`, one per line) and rehearses the capture as a schema-only dump
# to /dev/null — it proves the credential reaches the database and
# writes nothing. `--for-real` dumps, then `systemctl disable --now`
# each planned unit one at a time, printing `stopped+disabled <unit>` as
# it goes so a run killed at the runner's timeout still leaves an exact
# record, resets the unit's failed state, and finally lists the units
# again and refuses to claim success while any planned unit is still
# active.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It deletes no unit file, no binary, no config,
# no database: the dump is the capture, the stop is the retirement, and
# uninstalling is the converge's business once the role is gone (car
# 3). It never expands the list (no dependents, no globs). It does not
# touch postgres itself.
#
# USAGE
#   retire-second-stack.sh --dry-run | --for-real
#
# EXIT
#   0  done (or, with --dry-run, every bound passed and this is the plan)
#   2  refused — the reason names the unit or the bound; nothing stopped
#   1  failed part-way — the record states what was already stopped and
#      what was not touched; or a tool this needs could not answer
#
# ENV (test seams — the ops-runner passes no packet-supplied environment,
# only an argv built from the allowlist, so a packet cannot set these)
#   BOSS_RETIRE_UNITS_FILE   the list (default: second-stack-units.txt
#                            beside this script)
#   BOSS_RETIRE_BACKUP_DIR   where the dump lands
#                            (default: /var/backups/boss/second-stack)
#   BOSS_ESTATE_NODES_URL    see infra/estate/node-roles.sh
#   BOSS_NODE_ROLES          a pre-read role list wins (node-roles.sh)
