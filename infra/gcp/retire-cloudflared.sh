# retire-cloudflared — stop, disable and remove boss-gcp's hand-written
# `cloudflared.service`, the VM tunnel connector, once the system of
# record says the in-cluster connector carries every hostname — and
# nothing else, ever. It never touches the tunnel in Cloudflare.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (design 4c565f8c, decided by David 2026-09-16; backlog
# 0b7804f3, car 4)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# boss-gcp has run `cloudflared.service` since 2026-06-09: a unit
# `cloudflared service install` wrote by hand, its tunnel token INLINE
# on the ExecStart line (`tunnel run --token <v>`), declared in no role
# and observed by no estate observer (not a boss-* unit). On 2026-09-16
# the operator read that unit through unit-cat and the token rode the
# packet into the system of record (backlog 9c760dd7) — the mask has
# since learned the flag shape, and the rotation packet e202c7c3 moved
# every hostname onto a NEW tunnel whose connector runs IN the cluster
# (infra/cluster/manifests/cloudflared.yaml, car 1). The converge of
# 08:25Z recorded `cloudflared: connected` and a `tunnel_ingress`
# naming both hostnames. The VM connector is now redundancy nobody
# chose, still attached to the OLD tunnel that no hostname points at —
# and the rotation cannot finish while it is: the broker's revoke phase
# refuses to delete a tunnel with live connections, and this unit IS
# that connection. Retiring it is the last step of the leak's
# rotation, and the leak class is closed on this host by there being
# no token there.
#
# Retiring it by hand is four commands and a `rm` on a console, with
# nothing recording what the unit said the moment before or that the
# hand-over was real. So it is an ops verb through the audited door
# (infra/ops/verbs/retire-cloudflared.json), and this script is its
# whole mechanism.
#
# THE BOUNDS, in the order they are applied — each refuses loudly and
# names the bound:
#
#   1. THE MODE. Exactly one argument, `--dry-run` or `--for-real`. The
#      allowlist admits only those two literals; the script re-checks
#      rather than relying on one layer.
#   2. THE HOSTNAMES, from the tree. Every `hostname` the checkout's
#      infra/cluster/instances.toml declares — the ONE declaration the
#      tunnel ingress is rendered from (render-tunnel-config.sh) — is a
#      hostname the in-cluster connector must be serving. Never a list
#      typed here (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#   3. THE HAND-OVER, read through the system of record BEFORE anything
#      is stopped. The newest maintenance-cluster-converge packet whose
#      `run` step carries a `cloudflared` field is the newest converge
#      that OBSERVED the connector (since 0b7804f3 every tick does,
#      the no-op `unchanged` one included; an older tick that carries
#      no field is not evidence either way). It must be under two
#      hours old, must say `cloudflared: connected`, and its
#      `tunnel_ingress` must name every hostname from bound 2 as
#      `<hostname> →`. No such packet, a dark system of record, a stale
#      one, `not-ready`, `skipped (…)`, or a hostname missing from the
#      ingress is a refusal naming the packet and the fact. A bound
#      that cannot be evaluated is not passed. The read is SIGNED (the
#      x-boss-user header the runner itself uses): an unidentified read
#      of the jobs API answers `total: 0`, which is a denied scope, not
#      an empty world, and would read as "no converge" — a refusal,
#      never a pass, but a misleading one.
#   4. THE SNAPSHOT. `systemctl list-units --all 'cloudflared*'` and
#      the unit as systemd holds it, PRINTED THROUGH infra/ops/unit-cat.sh
#      — the same mask that door applies, so the token on the ExecStart
#      line leaves this host as `--token <masked by unit-cat>` and the
#      packet holds what the unit was without holding the credential.
#      The drop-in directory's contents are listed by name.
#   5. THE PLAN. Exactly `cloudflared.service`: present when its file is
#      under /etc/systemd/system or systemd lists it loaded. Absent on
#      both counts is `not on this host` and an OK with nothing to do —
#      the second run of this verb — never a refusal.
#
# `--dry-run` runs every bound, prints the snapshot and the plan
# (`would stop+disable+remove cloudflared.service`, plus each drop-in
# directory it would remove) and calls nothing that acts. `--for-real`
# then: `systemctl disable --now` (stops it, drops its symlinks), the
# unit file removed, `stopped+disabled+removed cloudflared.service`
# printed as it lands, the drop-in directory removed whole (the token
# lives in the unit file; a drop-in is the same author's), ONE
# daemon-reload, reset-failed, a second snapshot — and success is
# refused (exit 1, the unit named) while systemd still lists the unit
# or its file is still on disk.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never widens: the unit name is fixed here and
# nothing else on the host — boss-ops-runner (the door), boss-gcp-
# converge, WireGuard, caddy, postgres, a `cloudflared-update.timer`
# should one exist — is reachable, by construction. It does NOT touch
# the tunnel in Cloudflare: deleting the old tunnel is the broker's
# revoke phase (rotation packet e202c7c3), which completes on its own
# once that tunnel shows zero connections — which is what stopping this
# unit produces. It captures nothing: the unit is a token nobody should
# hold and a routing that lives in the tree.
#
# USAGE
#   retire-cloudflared.sh --dry-run | --for-real
#
# EXIT
#   0  done (or, with --dry-run, every bound passed and this is the plan)
#   2  refused — the reason names the bound; nothing stopped
#   1  failed part-way — the record states what was done and what was
#      not; or a tool this needs could not answer
#
# ENV (test seams — the ops-runner passes no packet-supplied environment,
# only an argv built from the allowlist, so a packet cannot set these)
#   BOSS_JOBS_URL      the system of record (the runner's unit pins it;
#                      unset is a refusal, never a default)
#   BOSS_OPS_ACTOR     who the converge read signs as (the runner's own
#                      variable; default automation:ops-runner)
#   INSTALL_ETC        where the unit lives (default /etc/systemd/system —
#                      the installer's own seam, same name, same default)
