# seed-operator-baseline.sh — POST the platform operator-baseline
# (emp-audit + the bootstrap-admin, injected from
# BOSS_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL or the first BOSS_AUTH_FILE credential)
# to a RUNNING people-api.
#
# Post-API by design: boss-operator-baseline-seed POSTs /api/people —
# the policy-checked, service-mediated path — so the API stack must be
# up. (It used to write audit_log directly via sqlx; that end-around
# was removed, which is why the old pre-API call sites in the docker
# init container + the bare-metal quickstart broke.) This script is the
# converged post-API seed step, called by the quickstart launchers just
# before the brewery tenant seed — the platform-baseline sibling of
# infra/seed-brewery-tenant.sh, and the same thing reset-to-baseline
# does inline at its step 6.
#
# Binaries are PATH-resolved: docker ships them in /usr/local/bin;
# bare-metal callers prepend target/release. Idempotent (409 on a
# duplicate id = skip); retries while the people-api finishes binding.
