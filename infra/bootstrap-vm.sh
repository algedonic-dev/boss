# bootstrap-vm.sh — single-command BOSS install on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM.
#
# Sequence:
#   0. apt packages (postgres, build deps, unzip)
#   1. Rust toolchain
#   2. Bun
#   3. Postgres role + DB bootstrap
#   4. NATS
#   5. cargo build --release --workspace (+ postgres-feature follow-ups)
#   6. Install binaries to /usr/local/bin
#   7. Re-seed registries (now that binaries are on PATH)
#   8. Deploy services
#   9. Tenant-specific seed (brewery OR used-device-shop)
#  10. Health-probe report
#
# Usage:
#   sudo TENANT=brewery        /opt/boss/infra/bootstrap-vm.sh
#   sudo TENANT=device-shop    /opt/boss/infra/bootstrap-vm.sh
#
# Designed to be idempotent — re-runs skip already-completed work
# where it's cheap to check. Intended for fresh-VM install
# verification ahead of a release cut.

# are not enabled, so a fresh VM never built them at all, and step 6
# below installed whatever happened to be in target/release.

# This is the drift build-release.sh's own header predicts, quoting the
# last instance of it: "Hand-maintaining a list of 'which crates need
# --features what' drifts instantly (deploy-services.sh's
# NEEDS_POSTGRES_FEATURE listed 7 of 17)." Same defect, same shape,
