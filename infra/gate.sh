# gate.sh — THE definition of the rust gate. CI's rust job invokes this
# script; anyone gating a car locally invokes this script. There is no
# second list of checks to drift from this one (CLAUDE.md §9a — on the
# 2026-08-10 train the gate's definition lived twice and drifted twice
# in one day; boss-testing/tests/gate_sh.rs pins this collapse).
#
# Usage:
#   infra/gate.sh                 # full gate — exactly what CI runs
#   infra/gate.sh --quick         # PRE-FLIGHT only: fmt + the lints
#                                 # that need no build, ~17s. Not a
#                                 # gate — nothing compiles. Run it
#                                 # before spending 17 minutes of
#                                 # cluster time on a formatting slip.
#   infra/gate.sh --lint          # --quick PLUS clippy, scoped to the

#                                 # that buys the least: prefer this to
#                                 # --quick before pushing. Still not a

# THE GATE'S GIT READS MUST WORK FOR WHATEVER UID THE GATE RUNS AS.

#
#     fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/work/boss'
#
# MEASURED as 65534 on this tree (packet 8674c440): `--quick` exits 1
# naming three pre-flight lints, and the defect is NOT three loud
# failures — it is five lints, failing three different ways:
#
#   no-secrets                 `git ls-files` refuses; the lint FAILS,
#                              printing the refusal. The honest one.
#   migrations-append-only     the trunk `rev-parse` is `2>/dev/null`,
#   steptype-bundle-ratchet    so the refusal is swallowed and the lint
#                              fails with "no trunk ref found … Fetch
#                              the trunk" — a confident WRONG diagnosis
#                              of an environment problem.
#   no-session-paths           `git grep` through pattern-scan.sh and
#   one-palette                one-palette's own call both end `|| true`.
#                              The scan returns nothing and the lint
#                              reports `clean`. A SILENT FALSE PASS:
#                              the gate certifies a tree it never read.
#
# The last pair is why the fix belongs HERE and not in the lints. A
# per-lint fix is three edits that have to FIND all five, and the two
# that matter most announce nothing when they are broken (CLAUDE.md §9a
# — that is the drift shape, not the fix). One exported env slot reaches
# every git in the child tree, including the lints nobody has written
# yet, and cannot drift from itself.
#
# git's env-var config channel, not a `git -c` on each call site, for
# the same reason: a call site list is the pair this repo keeps paying
# for.
#
# SCOPED TO THE RESOLVED ROOT, never `*`. Blessing one known path is a
# statement about this checkout; a wildcard would bless every repository
# any child ever reaches — the throwaway `git init` fixtures that
# migrations-append-only and an-expectation-names-a-rule build, the
# clones a probe makes — and those are exactly the repositories whose
# ownership nobody has vouched for.
#
# APPENDED after whatever `GIT_CONFIG_*` the caller already exports,
# the way `boss-cli`'s `git_auth::apply_at` appends:
# `infra/cluster/manifests/boss-dev.yaml` uses slot 0 for the forge
# credential helper, so a flat `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1` here would silently
# take that helper away from every child of the gate.
#
# WHY `safe.directory` IS RIGHT HERE AND WRONG IN
# `infra/forge/delete-orphan-object.sh`, which rejects it by name and
# drops to the tree's owner instead: that verb runs as root inside
# somebody else's clone, and a root WRITE there leaves root-owned
# objects that break the owner's later pulls — silencing the check would
# buy its read at the price of making that hazard reachable by the next
# edit. NOTHING IN THE GATE WRITES TO GIT: `--auto` diffs, the receipt
# reads HEAD, the lints read history and the index. That is the same
# distinction `infra/forge/publish-github-pr.sh` drew when it DID accept
# `safe.directory` for its fetch. Do not copy this to a path that
# writes, and do not widen it.
#
# It is not new trust, either: the gate is already EXECUTING this
# checkout's scripts, so declining to read its history was never a
# safety property — only a refusal in the wrong place.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The pre-flight set: every check that needs no build
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# `cargo fmt -- --check` and the lint roster are repo-wide greps and
# audits. Together they take ~17 SECONDS on a cold tree. They used to
# run near the END of the gate, behind clippy, the full test suite and
# the bun web suite.
#
# That ordering is not a bug — `check()` deliberately runs every check
# even after one fails, "a red gate should report every failure it can
# see, not make the author fix serially", and reordering saves a red
# gate nothing because it runs everything regardless.
#
# The cost lands somewhere else: there was no way to run the cheap
# checks WITHOUT the expensive ones. So the only way to find a
# formatting slip was to spend a gate. On 2026-08-27 a car did exactly
# that — 17 minutes of cluster time, a scheduled pod and a clone, to
# learn that `cargo fmt` had been run on one crate and not another.
# 17 seconds of local work, discovered 60x more slowly.
#
# Hence `--quick`, and hence this list existing ONCE. Two rosters would
# drift (CLAUDE.md §9a) and would drift in the worst direction: a check
# quietly missing from the local pre-flight still passes locally and
# still reds a full gate, which is precisely the failure being fixed.
#
# The roster is the DIRECTORY. Until 2026-09-05 it was a hand-listed
# array here, and every car that added a lint edited the same tail
# line: four cars collided on it in one day, and the fourth was left
# behind by train #218 ("conflict: infra/gate.sh"). That is the
# manifest.txt lesson (CLAUDE.md §9a) one level up — a list holding no
# information its source does not is a merge conflict waiting to
# happen. Adding a lint is now dropping a file in infra/lint/; this
# file does not change. The conductor's consist check reads the same
# directory and asks THIS SCRIPT what to leave out (train/consist.rs
# `gate_exclusions` runs `gate.sh --exclusions` in the assembled
# tree), so the two readers agree by construction rather than by
# being kept in step.
#
# What is NOT run here is declared BY THE LINT ITSELF, on one line of
# its header:
#
#     # consist: skip — <what a bare tree cannot answer in seconds>
#
# The header, not anywhere in the file: the first line that is not a
# comment ends it, so a lint that mentions the marker in its prose is
# not excluded by it. The reason is required — a bare declaration is
# refused by name, because an exemption nobody explained is one nobody
# can later judge. Each declaring lint needs something a bare tree
# cannot answer in seconds: a live database, a built workspace, a
# package manager.
#
# WHY THE LINT DECLARES IT, rather than a list here. Until 2026-09-18
# the exclusion set lived FIVE times — an array here, a hand copy in
# boss-testing's gate_sh.rs, the conductor's compiled fallback in
# delivery_policy.rs, the delivery-policy seed migration, and the live
# registry row — with two pins holding two of the pairs and NOTHING
# holding this array equal to what the conductor ran on (tech-debt
# audit H9, backlog 6fa15484). A fact the lint's author already knows
# when writing it (this needs psql; this needs a built binary) was
# being retyped four times by four other people. Now the lint says it
# once, this function reads it, `--exclusions` prints it, and every
# other reader asks here. The set is pinned by gate_sh.rs against the
# roster, both asked of this script rather than re-parsed from it.

# DISK FLOOR, before anything compiles — and after the listings above,

#
# On 2026-08-16 this box ran out of disk mid-`cargo build`. The failure
# was not a build error: the volume filled, the tool harness could no
# longer create a file to hold a command's output, and NOTHING would
# run — not the gate, not `df`, not the cleanup. Recovering it needed a
# human at a terminal.
#
# locomotive.sh has had exactly this check for the CI runner since
# 2026-08-14 (`min_free_gb`, default 70), written after a full disk
# surfaced as four unrelated boss-ledger tests failing on "could not
# extend file" and cost an hour of archaeology. Three hosts run builds
# — the runner, the dev pod, this box — and only the runner could say
# "not enough disk" before spending twenty minutes finding out. That
# asymmetry is the defect (CLAUDE.md 9a), not the number.
#
# A FLOOR, not a prediction. A cold workspace build measured ~74GB on
# the forge host; an incremental one on a warm target is a fraction of
# that, so a gate floor set at 74 would refuse almost every honest run.
# 12GB is set where it means something: below it a compile is likely to
# die partway and take the shell with it, and refusing costs two
# seconds instead of a wedged machine. It will not catch every
# too-tight case, and that is stated rather than papered over.
#
# The durable fix is not a bigger number: it is building in the dev pod
# (188GB on node-local scratch, one workspace instead of six worktrees
# each with their own target/). This is the guard for whichever host
# ends up running it.
#
# AND IT IS CHECKED BEFORE EVERY PHASE, not only at startup. A one-shot
# precondition cannot catch the failure it was written for: the run
# STARTS above the floor and then grows a `target/` — 32GB in the
# 2026-08-16 incident, 81GB on the Mac when this poll was added — so
# the only reading that matters is the one taken while the build is
# under way. `check()` is where every phase passes through, which makes
# it the poll point; the cost is one `df` per phase against a gate whose
# phases run for minutes.
#
# Tripping mid-run EXITS rather than recording a failed check. A gate
# that keeps going after this consumes the disk it just warned about,
# and the reported incident is precisely what that costs: the harness
# could no longer create the file it writes command output into, so
# `df` and `rm` stopped working too and the failure had disabled its

# `-p` states a belief; the tree states a fact
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Car mode asks the author which crates they changed, and on 2026-08-16
# the answer was wrong in the way that matters. A docs branch was gated
# `-p boss-docs` while `git add -A` had also swept an uncommitted
# crates/core/boss-jobs change into the commit — so the gate compiled
# the crate the author believed they touched, missed two independent
# defects in the one they had, and a three-car train went red on
# clippy (a6ffcb7c).
#
# The fix is not a new flag to remember. A flag you have to remember is
# the folklore this repo keeps paying for; the check has to fire
# exactly when `-p` is used, which is when the belief is being stated.
# So: derive the crate set from the tree and refuse a `-p` that does
# not cover it.
#
# Derivation is deliberately dumb — a path under crates/<tier>/<name>/
# means <name>. Two extras earn their place:
#
#   docs/design/ used to map to boss-docs, because those markdown files
#       were INPUT to a corpus gate: boss-docs/tests/docs_corpus_presents.rs
#       parsed every one, so a docs-only change really could fail a
#       crate's tests. That crate, the test and the corpus index behind
#       it were deleted on 2026-09-10 (backlog f5da586c) — the packet is
#       the doc — so docs/design/ now implies no crate, like every other
#       path under docs/. The rule it illustrated still holds for the
#       data files below: path-to-crate is not the same question as
#       which SOURCE files a crate compiles.
#
#   Data files some crate's test READS, so changing one can redden that
#   crate without touching a line of its source:
#     infra/gate.sh, infra/lint/*, .forgejo/workflows/ci.yml
#         -> boss-testing, which owns gate_sh.rs. That test pins that
#            ci.yml invokes this script, that this script runs every
#            check, and that every infra/lint/*.sh either runs in the
#            pre-flight or is named in its exclusion set. Omitting these would let `--auto` skip the only
#            test guarding the file being edited — which this very car
#            would have done to itself.
#            infra/lint/* ALSO implies boss-cli (added with backlog
#            294bb7c9): train/consist.rs's `the_roster_is_the_lint_directory
#            _itself` reads infra/lint/ and asserts every lint the
#            delivery policy excuses is STILL a file there, so deleting
#            or renaming a lint reddens the conductor's consist check.
#            The gate already compiles boss-testing for these paths;
#            compiling the other reader too is the cheap half.
#     infra/dispatcher/rules/*.toml -> boss-dispatcher, which owns
#            dispatcher_rules_seed.rs. It compares the seeded registry
#            against that directory in BOTH directions, and skipping the
#            authored half is what reddened the 13-car train
#            20260815-0621.
#            AND boss-brewery-engine, decided with backlog 294bb7c9.
#            protocol_holds_e2e.rs's `overhead_absorption_rules_agree`
#            reads three NAMED rule files and asserts the three overhead
#            drivers and their rates match the brewery's own table — a
#            §9a pin on a fact that lives twice, whose own doc comment
#            says "change a rate → change it here + in the rule's own
#            file". Scoped out, a rate edit passes the gate and the two
#            halves disagree silently. It is listed rather than derived
#            because the test assembles the filename at run time
#            (`rules_dir.join(format!("{name}.toml"))`), so no scan of
#            the source can see which rule files it reads; the derivation
#            below finds literals, not format strings.
#     examples/<tenant>/seeds/* -> boss-jobs for workflows.toml (its
#            seed_loader parses BOTH tenants' bundles through the
#            viability lint), boss-sim for tenant.toml (seven of its
#            shape-driven unit tests load that exact file),
#            boss-policy-client for policy_rules.toml (its loader's unit
#            tests parse both tenants' grants), and
#            boss-<tenant>-engine for anything in the bundle — four of
#            the brewery's TOMLs are `include_str!`d into that crate, so
#            they are compile input, and its layer-1 lint test reads the
#            directory. This line was missing until backlog b59efe54:
#            the rule above it was written for infra/platform/workflows
#            and the tenant's equivalent never got a line beside it, so
#            a bundle-only car scoped to ZERO crates and the one test
#            that can reject a broken predicate never ran on it. The
#            tenant name is DERIVED from the directory, never listed — a
#            brewery-only rule would have left the same hole for the
#            used-device-shop bundle and its 36 kinds.
#
#   Anything else (infra/, apps/, .forgejo/) maps to no crate and is
#       REPORTED rather than ignored. The lints already run repo-wide,
#       so there is nothing to scope — but the author should see the
#       list, because a file they did not expect is the whole warning.

# Following invariant-register.sh and no-secrets.sh: a check that

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Files a crate READS: derived from the tree, never listed here
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The rules below are hand-written path shapes, and hand-written shapes
# only cover the couplings somebody noticed. On 2026-09-10 a survey found
# the cost (backlog 294bb7c9): nine infra paths that a crate compiles in
# or a test executes mapped to NO crate, and one —
# infra/deploy-services.sh — was positively asserted to map to none while
# boss-ports `include_str!`s it. A car editing it scoped away the very
# test CLAUDE.md §9a cites as the fix for "two services silently absent
# from a deploy".
#
# So don't list them: DERIVE them. A crate that reads a file names that
# file, and the name is in the source. Two scans answer it, and each is
# one fact, not a roster:
#
#   A COMPILE INPUT escapes its own crate. `include_str!("../../../..
#   /infra/deploy-services.sh")`, a build.rs `.join("../../../infra/
#   estate/observe-lib.sh")`, a `#[cfg(test)]` read of `../../../infra/
#   gate-runner/gate-runner.yaml` — all are relative literals that climb
#   out of the crate, which is a shape nothing else has. Anywhere in the
#   crate's .rs, because `include_str!` and build.rs are not confined to
#   tests/.
#
#   A TEST SUBJECT is named repo-relative. boss-testing's script tests do
#   `read("infra/ops/ops-runner.sh")` from a root joined separately, so
#   there is no `../` to key on — but a plain repo path literal inside a
#   crate's tests/ directory that names an existing file is a fixture by
#   construction. Restricted to tests/ deliberately: the same literal in
#   src/ is usually prose (boss-content's 503 body mentions
#   infra/deploy-services.sh in a help string, and boss-policy's and
#   boss-jobs' port defaults mention it in comments), and mapping those
#   would compile three crates for a shell-script edit.
#
#   A PATH BEING JOINED is a path being read, wherever it sits. The
#   two shapes above left one idiom uncounted: a `#[cfg(test)]` module
#   under src/ reading `boss_testing::repo_root().join("docs/
#   tenant-contract.md")` — repo-relative, so not escaping, and not in
#   tests/. On 2026-09-19 train #470's car 4f1ba1f9 edited that doc
#   without editing the CONTRACT it is held equal to; the pin lives in
#   boss-cli's src/tenant.rs, the car derived boss-gateway alone, the
#   train gate derived the same, and origin/main went red on the pin
#   the first time anything ran it, striking the next car gated on top
#   (backlog 1b52c278). Measured at #471: eight (path, crate) pairs sat
#   outside the index this way (estate.toml, sor-ports.env,
#   pod-build.env, as-gate-uid.sh, access.toml, tax.toml, the contract
#   doc). What separates them from the prose the src/ restriction
#   exists for is the call around the literal: `.join("…")` is a path
#   being built, and a sentence never sits inside one. So a literal
#   whose immediate prefix is `.join(` counts in src/ too — still
#   subject to the existence test, so `dir.join("seeds/x.toml")` on a
#   scratch base maps to nothing because no such file sits at the root.
#
# RESOLVED AGAINST TWO BASES because the two idioms differ:
# `include_str!` is relative to the source FILE, while
# `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").join("../../../x")` is relative to the
# crate ROOT. A literal that lands on a real file under either is a
# reference to it; one that lands nowhere (`"../../etc/passwd"` in a
# traversal test, `"../fixtures/upstream.git"` in an assertion) is not,
# and the existence test is what separates them — no allow-list.
#
# TWO EXCLUSIONS, both measured, both deliberate:
#
#   infra/postgres/schema/** — boss-testing's build.rs compiles every
#   migration in, and boss-jobs names one in a test, so this scan would
#   map migrations to those TWO crates — an under-count, and a wrong
#   shape: a migration is read by every crate that stands up the
#   schema, not by the ones that mention it by path. `schema_readers`
#   below derives that set, and `path_map` applies it to any change
#   under this tree (backlog 4711828d).
#
#   docs/design/** — boss-jobs' subject_existence_pg.rs uses
#   "docs/design/subject-identity-and-relationships.md" as a Subject ID,
#   not as a file it reads. It is a path-shaped string that happens to
#   name a real file, so the existence test cannot tell it apart, and
#   including it would compile boss-jobs for any docs-only car. The one
#   real dependency in the docs tree (gate_sh.rs reads
#   docs/runbooks/dev-environment-bootstrap.md) is outside design/ and is
#   picked up normally.
#
# Cost: one awk pass over 843 .rs files, ~0.12s, once per invocation.
# `[ -f ]` is a builtin, so filtering the candidates costs no processes.
#
# `/dev/null` is passed to awk as a guaranteed file argument, and it is
# not decoration: GNU xargs runs the command once even with no input, and
# an awk with no file arguments reads STDIN — which here is the gate's own
# stdin. That is the same defect this car fixes on the other side (a
# check inheriting the gate's stdin), so the scanner must not commit it.
# A fixed file argument closes it portably, where `xargs -r` would not

# A migration is a change to every crate whose tests stand the schema
# up. On 2026-09-16 two cars each added a credentials-registry
# migration; `--auto` scoped each to the crates whose FILES changed
# (boss-dispatcher-handlers, boss-testing) and never ran boss-jobs,
# whose credentials_pg.rs pins the seeded rows. Both gated green
# (receipts 4c2f15c5, 719b6e61), the train gate ran boss-jobs on the
# assembled tree, and all six cars aboard were struck (train 767cfb14,
# gate-run 06995f6c; backlog 4711828d). Until then a migration-only car
# ran "fixture + lints only": the fixture proves the schema APPLIES,
# and nothing proved that what it seeds still agrees with the tests
# that read it.
#
# THE PREDICATE IS THE CONSTRUCTOR, not a feature flag or a file name.
# `boss_testing::TestDb::new` (and `new_without`) is the one call that
# applies infra/postgres/schema/ to a fresh database, so a crate that
# calls it anywhere in src/ or tests/ reads every migration. Measured
# on 2026-09-16 against the alternatives: "declares a `postgres`
# feature AND has tests/*_pg.rs" names 13 crates and drops
# boss-dispatcher (no feature, stands up a TestDb in rules_wait_pg.rs)
# and eleven others whose DB tests are named differently; the
# constructor names 25 — which is the whole Pg-tested workspace, and
# that is the honest answer, not a cost to optimise away. Correctness
# over speed: a migration-only gate now runs those 25 crates instead of
# none, ~2 minutes to a workspace-shaped run.
#
# Members come from `cargo metadata --no-deps` (~0.05 s, no resolution,
# no network), so a crate outside the workspace cannot be named and a
# `-p` it produces is one cargo can satisfy. The crate name is the
# manifest's directory, the same convention `path_shapes` reads off
# `crates/<tier>/<name>/`, and `scope_self_test` refuses a name that is
# not a crate. ~0.12 s in total, once per invocation, in every mode —
# `--quick` derives no scope and never reads it, but the cost is the

# lint roster and fmt are the entire useful gate, thirty seconds
# against eight to fifteen minutes.
#
# A FLAG, not the default, because bare `infra/gate.sh` is what CI
# invokes and must keep meaning "the whole workspace,
# unconditionally". A gate that quietly narrowed itself in CI would be
# the same hole as the mis-scoped `-p` that reddened a three-car train
# (a6ffcb7c), pointed the other way.
#
# THE SCHEMA IS THE SUBTLE PART. `infra/postgres/schema/**` is not a
# crate, but the shared fixture LOADS it into every DB-backed test in
# the workspace, so a schema-only change can break any of them. Until
# 2026-09-16 the answer was "fixture + lints only": the fixture proved
# the schema applied and no test that reads it ran (backlog 4711828d —
# two such cars struck a six-car train). Now `path_map` maps a schema
# change to every crate that stands up the schema (`schema_readers`),
# so a migration-only car derives a scope like any other and the
# fixture runs unscoped ahead of it as before. What remains here is the
# question the receipt asks: did the schema move at all — `schema_touched`,
# defined beside `schema_paths` above, because the `-p` refusal asks it
# too and runs first.

# Which ref is "the trunk" for deriving a branch's own commits. The
# remote-tracking main this repo actually uses, with the local branch
# and an override as fallbacks — a box whose remote is named
# differently must not silently fall through to gating nothing.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Running a roster
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The loop that runs every lint, and the three mechanisms that keep it
# from eating itself.
#
# Until 2026-09-10 this was `while read -r name path; do check "$name"
# bash "$path"; done <<< "$roster"`, which handed every lint the
# REMAINING ROSTER LINES as its stdin. Any lint that reads stdin — a
# `grep` or `awk` whose file list came out empty and so falls back to
# it, a bare `cat`, a `read` — consumed the rest of the roster. The loop
# then ended normally having run only the checks above it, and the gate
# printed `pre-flight: clean` and exited 0. MEASURED on a draft lint
# with an empty grep file list: a 61-lint roster ran NINE checks and the
# gate called it clean (backlog 9d5797d4).
#
# The irony is the point, and it is the comment the old loop carried: it
# ran `bash <path>` rather than executing the file precisely because "a
# lint that quietly could not run is the under-covering gate this roster
# exists to prevent". It guarded one way a lint silently does not run
# and introduced another.
#
# THREE mechanisms, because they fail differently:
#
#   `3<<<` / `<&3` — the ROSTER's defence. The list the loop reads is
#   not on a descriptor a child is handed by default, so no body this
#   loop ever grows can truncate it. A `< /dev/null` on the one call
#   below would have fixed the one call; the descriptor fixes the loop.
#
#   `< /dev/null` — the CHILD's defence, and worth keeping as well.
#   With only fd 3, a stdin-reading lint inherits whatever stdin the
#   GATE got: a pipe under the runner, a terminal by hand. The same lint
#   would then read different bytes, or block forever, depending on how
#   the gate was invoked. An explicit empty stdin makes it EOF
#   everywhere, which is the only answer a lint can be written against.
#
#   the COUNT — the unknown mechanism's defence. The two above close the
#   causes we know; a truncation is invisible by nature, so the loop
#   also asserts it ran as many checks as the roster holds and refuses
#   BY NAME when it did not, whatever ate them. fd 3 is deliberately
#   left open to the children rather than closed with `3<&-`: a lint
#   reading it directly is absurd but possible, and a loud count refusal
#   on that is worth more than closing the hole and leaving the count
#   with no failure mode anyone can exercise.
#
# `$runner` is `check` in the gate and a recorder in the self-test
# below, so the pin exercises THIS loop rather than a copy of it
# (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#
# `bash <path>` rather than executing it, as the consist check does: a
# checkout may not carry the executable bit, and a lint that quietly
# could not run is the under-covering gate this roster exists to
# prevent.

# out the pushed commit where the file IS tracked. MEASURED 2026-09-18
# (backlog a5efc919): the H12 builder's `--quick` said clean, and gate
# a3b26113 went red on `the-estate-address-lives-once` over a manifest
# the pre-flight had never been able to see.
#
# ONE refusal here, not `--others` taught to every reader: the readers
# are many (lib/pattern-scan.sh, lib/git-answer.sh, no-secrets's own
# `ls-files -z`, and the lints nobody has written yet), the refusal is
# one place, and a builder has to `git add` the file before committing

# `--lint` is `--quick` plus the one compiled check that pays for

#
# David, 2026-08-28: "Inherent slowness is fine. That just incentivizes
# us to squeeze out errors around those steps to ensure they are never
# wasted." A gate takes ~11 minutes and train CI ~15; a scoped clippy
# takes seconds on a warm tree. Trading the second for the first is the
# whole argument.
#
# SCOPED, NOT WORKSPACE. It clippies exactly the crates the tree
# changed, derived by the same `crates_from_paths` the `-p` refusal
# uses — so there is one definition of "which crates did this touch",
# not two. A change that maps to no crate (docs, infra, apps) skips
# clippy and says so, because there is nothing to compile.
#
# STILL NOT A GATE. The build and the test suites remain unproven, and
# a DB-backed test cannot run here at all. This narrows the red-gate
# classes by one; it does not replace the gate.
#
# THE SCOPE SELF-TEST RUNS HERE TOO, first, because it is the gate's
# first act on `--auto` and needs no build. Until 2026-09-23 it ran only
# on the gate's own paths, so a stale case in it passed `--lint` twice
# and then red gate-run 1f412b9e before any check ran, leaving no
# receipt (backlog d8637703). It exits 2 naming the case, as the gate
# does — and ahead of `crates_from_paths`, the map it checks, because
# the clippy scope below is derived from that map.
#

# checks its cases against this tree's crates and `cargo metadata`, so on
# a tree with no Cargo.toml — the synthetic trees boss-testing drives

# THE WEB SUITE. CI's web job runs typecheck + unit + build + the
# mocked Playwright suite; before this gate ran svelte-check alone, so
# a car could pass here and red the train on a check it never saw
# (§9a: this block and ci.yml's web job are two copies of one
# definition, kept in sync).
#
# FULL MODE RUNS IT UNCONDITIONALLY, matching CI — the full gate is the
# authoritative one and must not be narrower than the train it feeds.
# It used to be gated to `--auto` as well (`AUTO -eq 1 && web_touched`),
# which is exactly why `boss gate` runs full mode, skipped the suite,
# and let mocked-spec reds through: trains #160 (route crawl missed the
# estate page) and #161 (~35 specs after the IT consolidation moved
# surfaces) both died that way — ade5d82b. --auto keeps the old
# scoping, because a docs or Rust car iterating locally should not pay
# the suite unless it touched the web; CI and the full gate are the
# unconditional backstops. The browser is baked into boss-ci at
# /opt/ms-playwright (the keystone), so this needs no run-time download
# — the gate-runner points PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH there.
