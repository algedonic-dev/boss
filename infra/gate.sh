# gate.sh — THE definition of the rust gate. CI's rust job invokes this
# script; anyone gating a car locally invokes this script. There is no
# second list of checks to drift from this one (CLAUDE.md §9a — on the
# 2026-08-10 train the gate's definition lived twice and drifted twice
# in one day; boss-testing/tests/gate_sh.rs pins this collapse).
#
# Usage:
#   infra/gate.sh                 # full gate — exactly what CI runs
#   infra/gate.sh --auto          # car mode, scope DERIVED from the
#                                 # tree. Skips cargo entirely when
#                                 # nothing changed implies a crate —
#                                 # 74 of 164 live branches are in that
#                                 # class. Never used by CI.
#   infra/gate.sh -p crate [...]  # car mode — cargo phases scoped to
#                                 # the named crates (FULL suites, all
#                                 # features); lints + fmt always run
#                                 # repo-wide, they are cheap
#
# Car mode REFUSES a `-p` set that does not cover the crates the tree
# actually changes — see "`-p` states a belief" below.
#
# Environment setup (toolchain, dependency cache, schema apply for
# DB-backed tests) is the caller's job — CI does it in ci.yml steps,
# a dev box has it standing. The gate is the checks, nothing else.

# DISK FLOOR, before anything compiles.
#
# On 2026-08-16 this box ran out of disk mid-`cargo build`. The failure
# was not a build error: the volume filled, the tool harness could no
# longer create a file to hold a command's output, and NOTHING would
# run — not the gate, not `df`, not the cleanup. Recovering it needed a
# human at a terminal.
#
# locomotive.sh has had exactly this check for the CI runner since
# 2026-08-14 (`min_free_gb`, default 70), written after a full disk
# surfaced as four unrelated boss-ledger tests failing on "could not
# extend file" and cost an hour of archaeology. Three hosts run builds
# — the runner, the dev pod, this box — and only the runner could say
# "not enough disk" before spending twenty minutes finding out. That
# asymmetry is the defect (CLAUDE.md 9a), not the number.
#
# A FLOOR, not a prediction. A cold workspace build measured ~74GB on
# the forge host; an incremental one on a warm target is a fraction of
# that, so a gate floor set at 74 would refuse almost every honest run.
# 12GB is set where it means something: below it a compile is likely to
# die partway and take the shell with it, and refusing costs two
# seconds instead of a wedged machine. It will not catch every
# too-tight case, and that is stated rather than papered over.
#
# The durable fix is not a bigger number: it is building in the dev pod
# (188GB on node-local scratch, one workspace instead of six worktrees
# each with their own target/). This is the guard for whichever host
# ends up running it.
#
# AND IT IS CHECKED BEFORE EVERY PHASE, not only at startup. A one-shot
# precondition cannot catch the failure it was written for: the run
# STARTS above the floor and then grows a `target/` — 32GB in the
# 2026-08-16 incident, 81GB on the Mac when this poll was added — so
# the only reading that matters is the one taken while the build is
# under way. `check()` is where every phase passes through, which makes
# it the poll point; the cost is one `df` per phase against a gate whose
# phases run for minutes.
#
# Tripping mid-run EXITS rather than recording a failed check. A gate
# that keeps going after this consumes the disk it just warned about,
# and the reported incident is precisely what that costs: the harness
# could no longer create the file it writes command output into, so
# `df` and `rm` stopped working too and the failure had disabled its
# own diagnosis.

# `-p` states a belief; the tree states a fact
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Car mode asks the author which crates they changed, and on 2026-08-16
# the answer was wrong in the way that matters. A docs branch was gated
# `-p boss-docs` while `git add -A` had also swept an uncommitted
# crates/core/boss-jobs change into the commit — so the gate compiled
# the crate the author believed they touched, missed two independent
# defects in the one they had, and a three-car train went red on
# clippy (a6ffcb7c).
#
# The fix is not a new flag to remember. A flag you have to remember is
# the folklore this repo keeps paying for; the check has to fire
# exactly when `-p` is used, which is when the belief is being stated.
# So: derive the crate set from the tree and refuse a `-p` that does
# not cover it.
#
# Derivation is deliberately dumb — a path under crates/<tier>/<name>/
# means <name>. Two extras earn their place:
#
#   docs/design/  -> boss-docs. Those markdown files are INPUT to the
#       corpus gate (boss-docs/tests/docs_corpus_presents.rs parses
#       every one), so a docs-only change really can fail a crate's
#       tests. Path-to-crate is not the same question as which SOURCE
#       files a crate compiles.
#
#   The same reasoning, four more times — each one a file some crate's
#   test READS, so changing it can redden that crate without touching
#   a line of its source:
#     infra/gate.sh, infra/lint/*, .forgejo/workflows/ci.yml
#         -> boss-testing, which owns gate_sh.rs. That test pins that
#            ci.yml invokes this script, that this script runs every
#            check, and that every executable in infra/lint/ appears
#            here. Omitting these would let `--auto` skip the only
#            test guarding the file being edited — which this very car
#            would have done to itself.
#     infra/dispatcher/rules.toml -> boss-dispatcher, which owns
#            dispatcher_rules_seed.rs. It compares the seeded registry
#            against that file in BOTH directions, and skipping the
#            toml half is what reddened the 13-car train
#            20260815-0621.
#
#   Anything else (infra/, apps/, .forgejo/) maps to no crate and is
#       REPORTED rather than ignored. The lints already run repo-wide,
#       so there is nothing to scope — but the author should see the
#       list, because a file they did not expect is the whole warning.

# 36 trains): 79% of train reds surfaced only in `test`, the slowest
# stage, and the expensive ones were not a crate's logic failing. They
# were the shared fixture failing — the schema directory, or the TestDb
# harness itself — which reds every DB-backed crate at once.
#
# Those are exactly the breaks car mode could not see. `-p <crate>`
# answers "did I break my crate"; a fixture break belongs to everyone,
# so scoping the gate to the changed crate scoped the check away and the
# first thing to notice was a train. Running it unscoped here puts a
