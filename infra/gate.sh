# gate.sh — THE definition of the rust gate. CI's rust job invokes this
# script; anyone gating a car locally invokes this script. There is no
# second list of checks to drift from this one (CLAUDE.md §9a — on the
# 2026-08-10 train the gate's definition lived twice and drifted twice
# in one day; boss-testing/tests/gate_sh.rs pins this collapse).
#
# Usage:
#   infra/gate.sh                 # full gate — exactly what CI runs
#   infra/gate.sh --quick         # PRE-FLIGHT only: fmt + the lints
#                                 # that need no build, ~17s. Not a
#                                 # gate — nothing compiles. Run it
#                                 # before spending 17 minutes of
#                                 # cluster time on a formatting slip.
#   infra/gate.sh --auto          # car mode, scope DERIVED from the
#                                 # tree. Skips cargo entirely when
#                                 # nothing changed implies a crate —

#                                 # class. Never used by CI.
#   infra/gate.sh --self-test     # run the roster loop's own pin and

# THE GATE'S GIT READS MUST WORK FOR WHATEVER UID THE GATE RUNS AS.
#
# Since #310 (2026-09-11) the gate runs as uid 65534 / gid 1500, and
# every builder brief says to verify work under `setpriv --reuid=65534`.
# This pod's checkout is root-owned (`drwxrwsr-x root 1500`), so since
# git 2.35.2 every git command run by any other uid refuses it:
#
#     fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/work/boss'
#
# MEASURED as 65534 on this tree (packet 8674c440): `--quick` exits 1
# naming three pre-flight lints, and the defect is NOT three loud
# failures — it is five lints, failing three different ways:
#
#   no-secrets                 `git ls-files` refuses; the lint FAILS,
#                              printing the refusal. The honest one.
#   migrations-append-only     the trunk `rev-parse` is `2>/dev/null`,
#   steptype-bundle-ratchet    so the refusal is swallowed and the lint
#                              fails with "no trunk ref found … Fetch
#                              the trunk" — a confident WRONG diagnosis
#                              of an environment problem.
#   no-session-paths           `git grep` through pattern-scan.sh and
#   one-palette                one-palette's own call both end `|| true`.
#                              The scan returns nothing and the lint
#                              reports `clean`. A SILENT FALSE PASS:
#                              the gate certifies a tree it never read.
#
# The last pair is why the fix belongs HERE and not in the lints. A
# per-lint fix is three edits that have to FIND all five, and the two
# that matter most announce nothing when they are broken (CLAUDE.md §9a
# — that is the drift shape, not the fix). One exported env slot reaches
# every git in the child tree, including the lints nobody has written
# yet, and cannot drift from itself.
#
# git's env-var config channel, not a `git -c` on each call site, for
# the same reason: a call site list is the pair this repo keeps paying
# for.
#
# SCOPED TO THE RESOLVED ROOT, never `*`. Blessing one known path is a
# statement about this checkout; a wildcard would bless every repository
# any child ever reaches — the throwaway `git init` fixtures that
# migrations-append-only and an-expectation-names-a-rule build, the
# clones a probe makes — and those are exactly the repositories whose
# ownership nobody has vouched for.
#
# APPENDED after whatever `GIT_CONFIG_*` the caller already exports,
# the way `boss-cli`'s `git_auth::apply_at` appends:
# `infra/cluster/manifests/boss-dev.yaml` uses slot 0 for the forge
# credential helper, so a flat `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1` here would silently
# take that helper away from every child of the gate.
#
# WHY `safe.directory` IS RIGHT HERE AND WRONG IN
# `infra/forge/delete-orphan-object.sh`, which rejects it by name and
# drops to the tree's owner instead: that verb runs as root inside
# somebody else's clone, and a root WRITE there leaves root-owned
# objects that break the owner's later pulls — silencing the check would
# buy its read at the price of making that hazard reachable by the next
# edit. NOTHING IN THE GATE WRITES TO GIT: `--auto` diffs, the receipt
# reads HEAD, the lints read history and the index. That is the same
# distinction `infra/forge/publish-github-pr.sh` drew when it DID accept
# `safe.directory` for its fetch. Do not copy this to a path that
# writes, and do not widen it.
#
# It is not new trust, either: the gate is already EXECUTING this
# checkout's scripts, so declining to read its history was never a
# safety property — only a refusal in the wrong place.

# DISK FLOOR, before anything compiles.
#
# On 2026-08-16 this box ran out of disk mid-`cargo build`. The failure
# was not a build error: the volume filled, the tool harness could no
# longer create a file to hold a command's output, and NOTHING would
# run — not the gate, not `df`, not the cleanup. Recovering it needed a
# human at a terminal.
#
# locomotive.sh has had exactly this check for the CI runner since
# 2026-08-14 (`min_free_gb`, default 70), written after a full disk
# surfaced as four unrelated boss-ledger tests failing on "could not
# extend file" and cost an hour of archaeology. Three hosts run builds
# — the runner, the dev pod, this box — and only the runner could say
# "not enough disk" before spending twenty minutes finding out. That
# asymmetry is the defect (CLAUDE.md 9a), not the number.
#
# A FLOOR, not a prediction. A cold workspace build measured ~74GB on
# the forge host; an incremental one on a warm target is a fraction of
# that, so a gate floor set at 74 would refuse almost every honest run.
# 12GB is set where it means something: below it a compile is likely to
# die partway and take the shell with it, and refusing costs two
# seconds instead of a wedged machine. It will not catch every
# too-tight case, and that is stated rather than papered over.
#
# The durable fix is not a bigger number: it is building in the dev pod
# (188GB on node-local scratch, one workspace instead of six worktrees
# each with their own target/). This is the guard for whichever host
# ends up running it.
#
# AND IT IS CHECKED BEFORE EVERY PHASE, not only at startup. A one-shot
# precondition cannot catch the failure it was written for: the run
# STARTS above the floor and then grows a `target/` — 32GB in the
# 2026-08-16 incident, 81GB on the Mac when this poll was added — so
# the only reading that matters is the one taken while the build is
# under way. `check()` is where every phase passes through, which makes
# it the poll point; the cost is one `df` per phase against a gate whose
# phases run for minutes.
#
# Tripping mid-run EXITS rather than recording a failed check. A gate
# that keeps going after this consumes the disk it just warned about,
# and the reported incident is precisely what that costs: the harness
# could no longer create the file it writes command output into, so
# `df` and `rm` stopped working too and the failure had disabled its

# `-p` states a belief; the tree states a fact
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Car mode asks the author which crates they changed, and on 2026-08-16
# the answer was wrong in the way that matters. A docs branch was gated
# `-p boss-docs` while `git add -A` had also swept an uncommitted
# crates/core/boss-jobs change into the commit — so the gate compiled
# the crate the author believed they touched, missed two independent
# defects in the one they had, and a three-car train went red on
# clippy (a6ffcb7c).
#
# The fix is not a new flag to remember. A flag you have to remember is
# the folklore this repo keeps paying for; the check has to fire
# exactly when `-p` is used, which is when the belief is being stated.
# So: derive the crate set from the tree and refuse a `-p` that does
# not cover it.
#
# Derivation is deliberately dumb — a path under crates/<tier>/<name>/
# means <name>. Two extras earn their place:
#
#   docs/design/ used to map to boss-docs, because those markdown files
#       were INPUT to a corpus gate: boss-docs/tests/docs_corpus_presents.rs
#       parsed every one, so a docs-only change really could fail a
#       crate's tests. That crate, the test and the corpus index behind
#       it were deleted on 2026-09-10 (backlog f5da586c) — the packet is
#       the doc — so docs/design/ now implies no crate, like every other
#       path under docs/. The rule it illustrated still holds for the
#       data files below: path-to-crate is not the same question as
#       which SOURCE files a crate compiles.
#
#   Data files some crate's test READS, so changing one can redden that
#   crate without touching a line of its source:
#     infra/gate.sh, infra/lint/*, .forgejo/workflows/ci.yml
#         -> boss-testing, which owns gate_sh.rs. That test pins that
#            ci.yml invokes this script, that this script runs every
#            check, and that every infra/lint/*.sh either runs in the
#            pre-flight or is named in its exclusion set. Omitting these would let `--auto` skip the only
#            test guarding the file being edited — which this very car
#            would have done to itself.
#            infra/lint/* ALSO implies boss-cli (added with backlog
#            294bb7c9): train.rs's `the_roster_is_the_lint_directory
#            _itself` reads infra/lint/ and asserts every lint the
#            delivery policy excuses is STILL a file there, so deleting
#            or renaming a lint reddens the conductor's consist check.
#            The gate already compiles boss-testing for these paths;
#            compiling the other reader too is the cheap half.
#     infra/dispatcher/rules/*.toml -> boss-dispatcher, which owns
#            dispatcher_rules_seed.rs. It compares the seeded registry
#            against that directory in BOTH directions, and skipping the
#            authored half is what reddened the 13-car train
#            20260815-0621.
#            AND boss-brewery-engine, decided with backlog 294bb7c9.
#            protocol_holds_e2e.rs's `overhead_absorption_rules_agree`
#            reads three NAMED rule files and asserts the three overhead
#            drivers and their rates match the brewery's own table — a
#            §9a pin on a fact that lives twice, whose own doc comment
#            says "change a rate → change it here + in the rule's own
#            file". Scoped out, a rate edit passes the gate and the two
#            halves disagree silently. It is listed rather than derived
#            because the test assembles the filename at run time
#            (`rules_dir.join(format!("{name}.toml"))`), so no scan of
#            the source can see which rule files it reads; the derivation
#            below finds literals, not format strings.
#     examples/<tenant>/seeds/* -> boss-jobs for workflows.toml (its
#            seed_loader parses BOTH tenants' bundles through the
#            viability lint), boss-sim for tenant.toml (seven of its
#            shape-driven unit tests load that exact file),
#            boss-policy-client for policy_rules.toml (its loader's unit
#            tests parse both tenants' grants), and
#            boss-<tenant>-engine for anything in the bundle — four of
#            the brewery's TOMLs are `include_str!`d into that crate, so
#            they are compile input, and its layer-1 lint test reads the
#            directory. This line was missing until backlog b59efe54:
#            the rule above it was written for infra/platform/workflows
#            and the tenant's equivalent never got a line beside it, so
#            a bundle-only car scoped to ZERO crates and the one test
#            that can reject a broken predicate never ran on it. The
#            tenant name is DERIVED from the directory, never listed — a
#            brewery-only rule would have left the same hole for the
#            used-device-shop bundle and its 36 kinds.
#
#   Anything else (infra/, apps/, .forgejo/) maps to no crate and is
#       REPORTED rather than ignored. The lints already run repo-wide,
#       so there is nothing to scope — but the author should see the

# the cost (backlog 294bb7c9): nine infra paths that a crate compiles in

# infra/deploy-services.sh — was positively asserted to map to none while
# boss-ports `include_str!`s it. A car editing it scoped away the very
# test CLAUDE.md §9a cites as the fix for "two services silently absent
# from a deploy".
#
# So don't list them: DERIVE them. A crate that reads a file names that
# file, and the name is in the source. Two scans answer it, and each is
# one fact, not a roster:
#
#   A COMPILE INPUT escapes its own crate. `include_str!("../../../..

#   estate/observe-lib.sh")`, a `#[cfg(test)]` read of `../../../infra/
#   gate-runner/gate-runner.yaml` — all are relative literals that climb
#   out of the crate, which is a shape nothing else has. Anywhere in the
#   crate's .rs, because `include_str!` and build.rs are not confined to
#   tests/.
#
#   A TEST SUBJECT is named repo-relative. boss-testing's script tests do
#   `read("infra/ops/ops-runner.sh")` from a root joined separately, so
#   there is no `../` to key on — but a plain repo path literal inside a
#   crate's tests/ directory that names an existing file is a fixture by
#   construction. Restricted to tests/ deliberately: the same literal in
#   src/ is usually prose (boss-content's 503 body mentions
#   infra/deploy-services.sh in a help string, and boss-policy's and
#   boss-jobs' port defaults mention it in comments), and mapping those
#   would compile three crates for a shell-script edit.
#
# RESOLVED AGAINST TWO BASES because the two idioms differ:
# `include_str!` is relative to the source FILE, while
# `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").join("../../../x")` is relative to the
# crate ROOT. A literal that lands on a real file under either is a
# reference to it; one that lands nowhere (`"../../etc/passwd"` in a
# traversal test, `"../fixtures/upstream.git"` in an assertion) is not,
# and the existence test is what separates them — no allow-list.
#
# TWO EXCLUSIONS, both measured, both deliberate:
#
#   infra/postgres/schema/** — boss-testing's build.rs compiles every
#   migration in, and boss-jobs names one in a test, so this scan would
#   map migrations to crates. It must not: `--auto` asks `schema_touched`
#   separately and the unscoped `check "fixture"` below is what judges a
#   schema change in every mode. Mapping it here would compile two crates
#   per migration and answer a question the fixture already answers.
#
#   docs/design/** — boss-jobs' subject_existence_pg.rs uses
#   "docs/design/subject-identity-and-relationships.md" as a Subject ID,
#   not as a file it reads. It is a path-shaped string that happens to
#   name a real file, so the existence test cannot tell it apart, and
#   including it would compile boss-jobs for any docs-only car. The one
#   real dependency in the docs tree (gate_sh.rs reads
#   docs/runbooks/dev-environment-bootstrap.md) is outside design/ and is
#   picked up normally.
#
# Cost: one awk pass over 843 .rs files, ~0.12s, once per invocation.
# `[ -f ]` is a builtin, so filtering the candidates costs no processes.
#
# `/dev/null` is passed to awk as a guaranteed file argument, and it is
# not decoration: GNU xargs runs the command once even with no input, and
# an awk with no file arguments reads STDIN — which here is the gate's own
# stdin. That is the same defect this car fixes on the other side (a
# check inheriting the gate's stdin), so the scanner must not commit it.
# A fixed file argument closes it portably, where `xargs -r` would not
# (BSD xargs has no -r).

# The refusal above is the SAFETY half of scoping — it stops a `-p`
# that misses a crate. This is the efficiency half, and it is worth
# having on a measured basis: of 164 live branches, 74 touch no Rust
# at all, and two of the fourteen cars shipped on 2026-08-16 were in
# that class. For those, everything cargo does is dead weight — the
# lint roster and fmt are the entire useful gate, thirty seconds
# against eight to fifteen minutes.
#
# A FLAG, not the default, because bare `infra/gate.sh` is what CI
# invokes and must keep meaning "the whole workspace,
# unconditionally". A gate that quietly narrowed itself in CI would be
# the same hole as the mis-scoped `-p` that reddened a three-car train
# (a6ffcb7c), pointed the other way.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS THE SUBTLE PART. `infra/postgres/schema/**` maps to no
# crate, but the shared fixture LOADS the schema — so a schema-only
# change has no crate to compile and can still break every DB-backed
# test in the workspace. Skipping cargo entirely there would scope away
# the exact break the fixture check exists to catch, which is what the
# comment above `check "fixture"` warns about. So the derivation
# answers two questions: which crates, and whether the fixture is
# implicated.

# The pre-flight set: every check that needs no build

# `cargo fmt -- --check` and the lint roster are repo-wide greps and
# audits. Together they take ~17 SECONDS on a cold tree. They used to
# run near the END of the gate, behind clippy, the full test suite and
# the bun web suite.
#
# That ordering is not a bug — `check()` deliberately runs every check
# even after one fails, "a red gate should report every failure it can
# see, not make the author fix serially", and reordering saves a red
# gate nothing because it runs everything regardless.
#
# The cost lands somewhere else: there was no way to run the cheap
# checks WITHOUT the expensive ones. So the only way to find a
# formatting slip was to spend a gate. On 2026-08-27 a car did exactly
# that — 17 minutes of cluster time, a scheduled pod and a clone, to
# learn that `cargo fmt` had been run on one crate and not another.
# 17 seconds of local work, discovered 60x more slowly.
#
# Hence `--quick`, and hence this list existing ONCE. Two rosters would
# drift (CLAUDE.md §9a) and would drift in the worst direction: a check
# quietly missing from the local pre-flight still passes locally and
# still reds a full gate, which is precisely the failure being fixed.
#
# The roster is the DIRECTORY. Until 2026-09-05 it was a hand-listed
# array here, and every car that added a lint edited the same tail
# line: four cars collided on it in one day, and the fourth was left
# behind by train #218 ("conflict: infra/gate.sh"). That is the
# manifest.txt lesson (CLAUDE.md §9a) one level up — a list holding no
# information its source does not is a merge conflict waiting to
# happen. Adding a lint is now dropping a file in infra/lint/; this
# file does not change. The conductor's consist check discovers its
# lints the same way (train.rs `cheap_lints`: every infra/lint/*.sh,
# sorted, minus the delivery policy's exclusions), so the two readers
# agree by construction rather than by being kept in step.
#
# What is NOT run here is written down once, with its reason. Each
# needs something a bare tree cannot answer in seconds. The set is
# pinned by boss-testing's gate_sh.rs, which asks this script (via
# `--roster`) rather than re-parsing it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Running a roster
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The loop that runs every lint, and the three mechanisms that keep it
# from eating itself.
#
# Until 2026-09-10 this was `while read -r name path; do check "$name"
# bash "$path"; done <<< "$roster"`, which handed every lint the
# REMAINING ROSTER LINES as its stdin. Any lint that reads stdin — a
# `grep` or `awk` whose file list came out empty and so falls back to
# it, a bare `cat`, a `read` — consumed the rest of the roster. The loop
# then ended normally having run only the checks above it, and the gate
# printed `pre-flight: clean` and exited 0. MEASURED on a draft lint
# with an empty grep file list: a 61-lint roster ran NINE checks and the
# gate called it clean (backlog 9d5797d4).
#
# The irony is the point, and it is the comment the old loop carried: it
# ran `bash <path>` rather than executing the file precisely because "a
# lint that quietly could not run is the under-covering gate this roster
# exists to prevent". It guarded one way a lint silently does not run
# and introduced another.
#
# THREE mechanisms, because they fail differently:
#
#   `3<<<` / `<&3` — the ROSTER's defence. The list the loop reads is
#   not on a descriptor a child is handed by default, so no body this
#   loop ever grows can truncate it. A `< /dev/null` on the one call
#   below would have fixed the one call; the descriptor fixes the loop.
#
#   `< /dev/null` — the CHILD's defence, and worth keeping as well.
#   With only fd 3, a stdin-reading lint inherits whatever stdin the
#   GATE got: a pipe under the runner, a terminal by hand. The same lint
#   would then read different bytes, or block forever, depending on how
#   the gate was invoked. An explicit empty stdin makes it EOF
#   everywhere, which is the only answer a lint can be written against.
#
#   the COUNT — the unknown mechanism's defence. The two above close the
#   causes we know; a truncation is invisible by nature, so the loop
#   also asserts it ran as many checks as the roster holds and refuses
#   BY NAME when it did not, whatever ate them. fd 3 is deliberately
#   left open to the children rather than closed with `3<&-`: a lint
#   reading it directly is absurd but possible, and a loud count refusal
#   on that is worth more than closing the hole and leaving the count
#   with no failure mode anyone can exercise.
#
# `$runner` is `check` in the gate and a recorder in the self-test
# below, so the pin exercises THIS loop rather than a copy of it
# (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#
# `bash <path>` rather than executing it, as the consist check does: a
# checkout may not carry the executable bit, and a lint that quietly
# could not run is the under-covering gate this roster exists to
# prevent.

# takes seconds on a warm tree. Trading the second for the first is the
# whole argument.

# SCOPED, NOT WORKSPACE. It clippies exactly the crates the tree
# changed, derived by the same `crates_from_paths` the `-p` refusal
# uses — so there is one definition of "which crates did this touch",
# not two. A change that maps to no crate (docs, infra, apps) skips
# clippy and says so, because there is nothing to compile.
#
# STILL NOT A GATE. The build and the test suites remain unproven, and
