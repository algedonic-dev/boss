# gate.sh — THE definition of the rust gate. CI's rust job invokes this
# script; anyone gating a car locally invokes this script. There is no
# second list of checks to drift from this one (CLAUDE.md §9a — on the
# 2026-08-10 train the gate's definition lived twice and drifted twice
# in one day; boss-testing/tests/gate_sh.rs pins this collapse).
#
# Usage:
#   infra/gate.sh                 # full gate — exactly what CI runs
#   infra/gate.sh --quick         # PRE-FLIGHT only: fmt + the lints
#                                 # that need no build, run 8 at a
#                                 # time: 23-36s on the dev pod
#                                 # (2026-09-25; 132s one at a time).
#                                 # Not a gate — nothing compiles. Run
#                                 # it before spending 17 minutes of
#                                 # cluster time on a formatting slip.
#   infra/gate.sh --lint          # --quick PLUS workspace clippy when
#                                 # the change implies a crate. Checks
#                                 # dependent test targets too; warm

# THE GATE'S GIT READS MUST WORK FOR WHATEVER UID THE GATE RUNS AS.

# Since #310 (2026-09-11) the gate runs as uid 65534 / gid 1500, and
# every builder brief says to verify work under `setpriv --reuid=65534`.
# This pod's checkout is root-owned (`drwxrwsr-x root 1500`), so since
# git 2.35.2 every git command run by any other uid refuses it:
#
#     fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/work/boss'
#
# MEASURED as 65534 on this tree (packet 8674c440): `--quick` exits 1
# naming three pre-flight lints, and the defect is NOT three loud
# failures — it is five lints, failing three different ways:
#
#   no-secrets                 `git ls-files` refuses; the lint FAILS,
#                              printing the refusal. The honest one.
#   migrations-append-only     the trunk `rev-parse` is `2>/dev/null`,
#   steptype-bundle-ratchet    so the refusal is swallowed and the lint
#                              fails with "no trunk ref found … Fetch
#                              the trunk" — a confident WRONG diagnosis
#                              of an environment problem.
#   no-session-paths           `git grep` through pattern-scan.sh and
#   one-palette                one-palette's own call both end `|| true`.
#                              The scan returns nothing and the lint
#                              reports `clean`. A SILENT FALSE PASS:
#                              the gate certifies a tree it never read.
#
# The last pair is why the fix belongs HERE and not in the lints. A
# per-lint fix is three edits that have to FIND all five, and the two
# that matter most announce nothing when they are broken (CLAUDE.md §9a
# — that is the drift shape, not the fix). One exported env slot reaches
# every git in the child tree, including the lints nobody has written
# yet, and cannot drift from itself.
#
# git's env-var config channel, not a `git -c` on each call site, for
# the same reason: a call site list is the pair this repo keeps paying
# for.
#
# SCOPED TO THE RESOLVED ROOT, never `*`. Blessing one known path is a
# statement about this checkout; a wildcard would bless every repository
# any child ever reaches — the throwaway `git init` fixtures that
# migrations-append-only and an-expectation-names-a-rule build, the
# clones a probe makes — and those are exactly the repositories whose
# ownership nobody has vouched for.
#
# APPENDED after whatever `GIT_CONFIG_*` the caller already exports,
# the way `boss-cli`'s `git_auth::apply_at` appends:
# `infra/cluster/manifests/boss-dev.yaml` uses slot 0 for the forge
# credential helper, so a flat `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1` here would silently
# take that helper away from every child of the gate.
#
# WHY `safe.directory` IS RIGHT HERE AND WRONG IN
# `infra/forge/delete-orphan-object.sh`, which rejects it by name and
# drops to the tree's owner instead: that verb runs as root inside
# somebody else's clone, and a root WRITE there leaves root-owned
# objects that break the owner's later pulls — silencing the check would
# buy its read at the price of making that hazard reachable by the next
# edit. NOTHING IN THE GATE WRITES TO GIT: `--auto` diffs, the receipt
# reads HEAD, the lints read history and the index. That is the same
# distinction `infra/forge/publish-github-pr.sh` drew when it DID accept
# `safe.directory` for its fetch. Do not copy this to a path that
# writes, and do not widen it.
#
# It is not new trust, either: the gate is already EXECUTING this
# checkout's scripts, so declining to read its history was never a
# safety property — only a refusal in the wrong place.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The pre-flight set: every check that needs no build
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# `cargo fmt -- --check` and the lint roster are repo-wide greps and
# audits. Together they took ~17 SECONDS on a cold tree when this was
# written; by 2026-09-24 the roster had grown to 90 lints and 106 s,
# which is why it now runs concurrently ("Running a roster"). They used to
# run near the END of the gate, behind clippy, the full test suite and
# the bun web suite.
#
# That ordering is not a bug — `check()` deliberately runs every check
# even after one fails, "a red gate should report every failure it can
# see, not make the author fix serially", and reordering saves a red
# gate nothing because it runs everything regardless.
#
# The cost lands somewhere else: there was no way to run the cheap
# checks WITHOUT the expensive ones. So the only way to find a
# formatting slip was to spend a gate. On 2026-08-27 a car did exactly
# that — 17 minutes of cluster time, a scheduled pod and a clone, to
# learn that `cargo fmt` had been run on one crate and not another.
# 17 seconds of local work, discovered 60x more slowly.
#
# Hence `--quick`, and hence this list existing ONCE. Two rosters would
# drift (CLAUDE.md §9a) and would drift in the worst direction: a check
# quietly missing from the local pre-flight still passes locally and
# still reds a full gate, which is precisely the failure being fixed.
#
# The roster is the DIRECTORY. Until 2026-09-05 it was a hand-listed
# array here, and every car that added a lint edited the same tail
# line: four cars collided on it in one day, and the fourth was left
# behind by train #218 ("conflict: infra/gate.sh"). That is the
# manifest.txt lesson (CLAUDE.md §9a) one level up — a list holding no
# information its source does not is a merge conflict waiting to
# happen. Adding a lint is now dropping a file in infra/lint/; this
# file does not change. The conductor's consist check reads the same
# directory and asks THIS SCRIPT what to leave out (train/consist.rs
# `gate_exclusions` runs `gate.sh --exclusions` in the assembled
# tree), so the two readers agree by construction rather than by
# being kept in step.
#
# What is NOT run here is declared BY THE LINT ITSELF, on one line of
# its header:
#
#     # consist: skip — <what a bare tree cannot answer in seconds>
#
# The header, not anywhere in the file: the first line that is not a
# comment ends it, so a lint that mentions the marker in its prose is
# not excluded by it. The reason is required — a bare declaration is
# refused by name, because an exemption nobody explained is one nobody
# can later judge. Each declaring lint needs something a bare tree
# cannot answer in seconds: a live database, a built workspace, a
# package manager.
#
# WHY THE LINT DECLARES IT, rather than a list here. Until 2026-09-18
# the exclusion set lived FIVE times — an array here, a hand copy in
# boss-testing's gate_sh.rs, the conductor's compiled fallback in
# delivery_policy.rs, the delivery-policy seed migration, and the live
# registry row — with two pins holding two of the pairs and NOTHING
# holding this array equal to what the conductor ran on (tech-debt
# audit H9, backlog 6fa15484). A fact the lint's author already knows
# when writing it (this needs psql; this needs a built binary) was
# being retyped four times by four other people. Now the lint says it
# once, this function reads it, `--exclusions` prints it, and every
# other reader asks here. The set is pinned by gate_sh.rs against the
# roster, both asked of this script rather than re-parsed from it.
#
# The reader is `header_declarations`, shared with the serial lane
# below (`# preflight: serial — <why>`): one parser for "what a lint
# says about itself in its header", so the two declarations cannot come
# to disagree about where a header ends or what counts as a reason.

# by gate_sh.rs `a_lint_that_reads_the_live_record_runs_in_the_serial_
# lane`), and one that holds host-wide state (`cargo-advisories` and

# THE LISTINGS ANSWER BEFORE EVERY REFUSAL. `--roster` and `--exclusions`

# Refusing to start." and the consist check recorded a failure it could
# not judge (backlog 13700f6f; CLAUDE.md Diagnosis: an infrastructure
# refusal is not a consist failure). The floor guards a gate RUN — a

# DISK FLOOR, before anything compiles — and after the listings above,

#
# On 2026-08-16 this box ran out of disk mid-`cargo build`. The failure
# was not a build error: the volume filled, the tool harness could no
# longer create a file to hold a command's output, and NOTHING would
# run — not the gate, not `df`, not the cleanup. Recovering it needed a
# human at a terminal.
#
# locomotive.sh has had exactly this check for the CI runner since
# 2026-08-14 (`min_free_gb`, default 70), written after a full disk
# surfaced as four unrelated boss-ledger tests failing on "could not
# extend file" and cost an hour of archaeology. Three hosts run builds
# — the runner, the dev pod, this box — and only the runner could say
# "not enough disk" before spending twenty minutes finding out. That
# asymmetry is the defect (CLAUDE.md 9a), not the number.
#
# A FLOOR, not a prediction. A cold workspace build measured ~74GB on
# the forge host; an incremental one on a warm target is a fraction of
# that, so a gate floor set at 74 would refuse almost every honest run.
# 12GB is set where it means something: below it a compile is likely to
# die partway and take the shell with it, and refusing costs two
# seconds instead of a wedged machine. It will not catch every
# too-tight case, and that is stated rather than papered over.
#
# The durable fix is not a bigger number: it is building in the dev pod
# (188GB on node-local scratch, one workspace instead of six worktrees
# each with their own target/). This is the guard for whichever host
# ends up running it.
#
# AND IT IS CHECKED BEFORE EVERY PHASE, not only at startup. A one-shot
# precondition cannot catch the failure it was written for: the run
# STARTS above the floor and then grows a `target/` — 32GB in the
# 2026-08-16 incident, 81GB on the Mac when this poll was added — so
# the only reading that matters is the one taken while the build is
# under way. `check()` is where every phase passes through, which makes
# it the poll point; the cost is one `df` per phase against a gate whose
# phases run for minutes.
#
# Tripping mid-run EXITS rather than recording a failed check. A gate
# that keeps going after this consumes the disk it just warned about,
# and the reported incident is precisely what that costs: the harness
# could no longer create the file it writes command output into, so
# `df` and `rm` stopped working too and the failure had disabled its
# own diagnosis.

# the automatic pass never fired before this refused, and two builders

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# `-p` states a belief; the tree states a fact
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Car mode asks the author which crates they changed, and on 2026-08-16
# the answer was wrong in the way that matters. A docs branch was gated
# `-p boss-docs` while `git add -A` had also swept an uncommitted
# crates/core/boss-jobs change into the commit — so the gate compiled
# the crate the author believed they touched, missed two independent
# defects in the one they had, and a three-car train went red on
# clippy (a6ffcb7c).
#
# The fix is not a new flag to remember. A flag you have to remember is
# the folklore this repo keeps paying for; the check has to fire
# exactly when `-p` is used, which is when the belief is being stated.
# So: derive the crate set from the tree and refuse a `-p` that does
# not cover it.
#
# Derivation is deliberately dumb — a path under crates/<tier>/<name>/
# means <name>. Two extras earn their place:
#
#   docs/design/ used to map to boss-docs, because those markdown files
#       were INPUT to a corpus gate: boss-docs/tests/docs_corpus_presents.rs
#       parsed every one, so a docs-only change really could fail a
#       crate's tests. That crate, the test and the corpus index behind
#       it were deleted on 2026-09-10 (backlog f5da586c) — the packet is
#       the doc — so docs/design/ now implies no crate, like every other
#       path under docs/. The rule it illustrated still holds for the
#       data files below: path-to-crate is not the same question as
#       which SOURCE files a crate compiles.
#
#   Data files some crate's test READS, so changing one can redden that
#   crate without touching a line of its source:
#     infra/gate.sh, infra/lint/*, .forgejo/workflows/ci.yml
#         -> boss-testing, which owns gate_sh.rs. That test pins that
#            ci.yml invokes this script, that this script runs every
#            check, and that every infra/lint/*.sh either runs in the
#            pre-flight or is named in its exclusion set. Omitting these would let `--auto` skip the only
#            test guarding the file being edited — which this very car
#            would have done to itself.
#            infra/lint/* ALSO implies boss-cli (added with backlog
#            294bb7c9): train/consist.rs's `the_roster_is_the_lint_directory
#            _itself` reads infra/lint/ and asserts every lint the
#            delivery policy excuses is STILL a file there, so deleting
#            or renaming a lint reddens the conductor's consist check.
#            The gate already compiles boss-testing for these paths;
#            compiling the other reader too is the cheap half.
#     infra/dispatcher/rules/*.toml -> every crate that calls
#            `boss_testing::dispatcher_rules_dir()`, DERIVED by
#            `rules_crates` below rather than listed on this line
#            (backlog a6100e01) — boss-dispatcher, which owns
#            dispatcher_rules_seed.rs. It compares the seeded registry
#            against that directory in BOTH directions, and skipping the
#            authored half is what reddened the 13-car train
#            20260815-0621.
#            AND boss-brewery-engine, decided with backlog 294bb7c9 —
#            the one reader still on the shape line.
#            protocol_holds_e2e.rs's `overhead_absorption_rules_agree`
#            reads three NAMED rule files and asserts the three overhead
#            drivers and their rates match the brewery's own table — a
#            §9a pin on a fact that lives twice, whose own doc comment
#            says "change a rate → change it here + in the rule's own
#            file". Scoped out, a rate edit passes the gate and the two
#            halves disagree silently. It is listed rather than derived
#            because the test assembles the filename at run time
#            (`rules_dir.join(format!("{name}.toml"))`), so no scan of
#            the source can see which rule files it reads; the derivation
#            below finds literals, not format strings.
#            AND boss-dispatcher-handlers (backlog 757a67bd): cascade.rs's
#            `every_shipped_trigger_has_something_upstream` reads every
#            rule through `boss_testing::dispatcher_rules_dir()`, a call
#            no literal scan sees, so a rule whose trigger had nothing
#            upstream gated green and landed main red (#770). That test
#            is ALSO a tree-wide pin, so a train scoped off its consist
#            runs it too; the derivation runs the crate's whole suite.
#            AND boss-testing, whose four rule-reading script tests the
#            hand list still missed after #770 — which is why the list
#            became a derivation (backlog a6100e01).
#     examples/<tenant>/seeds/* -> boss-jobs for workflows.toml (its
#            seed_loader parses the brewery's bundle through the
#            viability lint), boss-sim for tenant.toml (seven of its
#            shape-driven unit tests load that exact file),
#            boss-policy-client for policy_rules.toml (its loader's unit
#            tests parse the brewery's grants), and
#            boss-<tenant>-engine for anything in the bundle — four of
#            the brewery's TOMLs are `include_str!`d into that crate, so
#            they are compile input, and its layer-1 lint test reads the
#            directory. This line was missing until backlog b59efe54:
#            the rule above it was written for infra/platform/workflows
#            and the tenant's equivalent never got a line beside it, so
#            a bundle-only car scoped to ZERO crates and the one test
#            that can reject a broken predicate never ran on it. The
#            tenant name is DERIVED from the directory, never listed — a
#            brewery-only rule would have left the same hole for the
#            used-device-shop bundle and its 36 kinds while it lived
#            (retired 2026-09-24, backlog a8991c86), and for the next.
#
#   Anything else (infra/, apps/, .forgejo/) maps to no crate and is
#       REPORTED rather than ignored. The lints already run repo-wide,
#       so there is nothing to scope — but the author should see the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Files a crate READS: derived from the tree, never listed here
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The rules below are hand-written path shapes, and hand-written shapes
# only cover the couplings somebody noticed. On 2026-09-10 a survey found
# the cost (backlog 294bb7c9): nine infra paths that a crate compiles in
# or a test executes mapped to NO crate, and one —
# infra/deploy-services.sh — was positively asserted to map to none while
# boss-ports `include_str!`s it. A car editing it scoped away the very
# test CLAUDE.md §9a cites as the fix for "two services silently absent
# from a deploy".
#
# So don't list them: DERIVE them. A crate that reads a file names that
# file, and the name is in the source. Two scans answer it, and each is
# one fact, not a roster:
#
#   A COMPILE INPUT escapes its own crate. `include_str!("../../../..
#   /infra/deploy-services.sh")`, a build.rs `.join("../../../infra/
#   estate/observe-lib.sh")`, a `#[cfg(test)]` read of `../../../infra/
#   gate-runner/gate-runner.yaml` — all are relative literals that climb
#   out of the crate, which is a shape nothing else has. Anywhere in the
#   crate's .rs, because `include_str!` and build.rs are not confined to
#   tests/.
#
#   A TEST SUBJECT is named repo-relative. boss-testing's script tests do
#   `read("infra/ops/ops-runner.sh")` from a root joined separately, so
#   there is no `../` to key on — but a plain repo path literal inside a
#   crate's tests/ directory that names an existing file is a fixture by
#   construction. Restricted to tests/ deliberately: the same literal in
#   src/ is usually prose (boss-content's 503 body mentions
#   infra/deploy-services.sh in a help string, and boss-policy's and
#   boss-jobs' port defaults mention it in comments), and mapping those
#   would compile three crates for a shell-script edit.
#
#   A PATH BEING JOINED is a path being read, wherever it sits. The
#   two shapes above left one idiom uncounted: a `#[cfg(test)]` module
#   under src/ reading `boss_testing::repo_root().join("docs/
#   tenant-contract.md")` — repo-relative, so not escaping, and not in
#   tests/. On 2026-09-19 train #470's car 4f1ba1f9 edited that doc
#   without editing the CONTRACT it is held equal to; the pin lives in
#   boss-cli's src/tenant.rs, the car derived boss-gateway alone, the
#   train gate derived the same, and origin/main went red on the pin
#   the first time anything ran it, striking the next car gated on top
#   (backlog 1b52c278). Measured at #471: eight (path, crate) pairs sat
#   outside the index this way (estate.toml, sor-ports.env,
#   pod-build.env, as-gate-uid.sh, access.toml, tax.toml, the contract
#   doc). What separates them from the prose the src/ restriction
#   exists for is the call around the literal: `.join("…")` is a path
#   being built, and a sentence never sits inside one. So a literal
#   whose immediate prefix is `.join(` counts in src/ too — still
#   subject to the existence test, so `dir.join("seeds/x.toml")` on a
#   scratch base maps to nothing because no such file sits at the root.
#
# RESOLVED AGAINST TWO BASES because the two idioms differ:
# `include_str!` is relative to the source FILE, while
# `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").join("../../../x")` is relative to the
# crate ROOT. A literal that lands on a real file under either is a
# reference to it; one that lands nowhere (`"../../etc/passwd"` in a
# traversal test, `"../fixtures/upstream.git"` in an assertion) is not,
# and the existence test is what separates them — no allow-list.
#
# TWO EXCLUSIONS, both measured, both deliberate:
#
#   infra/postgres/schema/** — boss-testing's build.rs compiles every
#   migration in, and boss-jobs names one in a test, so this scan would
#   map migrations to those TWO crates — an under-count, and a wrong
#   shape: a migration is read by every crate that stands up the
#   schema, not by the ones that mention it by path. `schema_readers`
#   below derives that set, and `path_map` applies it to any change
#   under this tree (backlog 4711828d).
#
#   docs/design/** — boss-jobs' subject_existence_pg.rs uses
#   "docs/design/subject-identity-and-relationships.md" as a Subject ID,
#   not as a file it reads. It is a path-shaped string that happens to
#   name a real file, so the existence test cannot tell it apart, and
#   including it would compile boss-jobs for any docs-only car. The one
#   real dependency in the docs tree (gate_sh.rs reads
#   docs/runbooks/dev-environment-bootstrap.md) is outside design/ and is
#   picked up normally.
#
# Cost: one awk pass over 843 .rs files, ~0.12s, once per invocation.
# `[ -f ]` is a builtin, so filtering the candidates costs no processes.
#
# `/dev/null` is passed to awk as a guaranteed file argument, and it is
# not decoration: GNU xargs runs the command once even with no input, and
# an awk with no file arguments reads STDIN — which here is the gate's own
# stdin. That is the same defect this car fixes on the other side (a
# check inheriting the gate's stdin), so the scanner must not commit it.
# A fixed file argument closes it portably, where `xargs -r` would not

# Crates that READ THE SCHEMA: derived from the tree, never listed here
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# A migration is a change to every crate whose tests stand the schema
# up. On 2026-09-16 two cars each added a credentials-registry
# migration; `--auto` scoped each to the crates whose FILES changed
# (boss-dispatcher-handlers, boss-testing) and never ran boss-jobs,
# whose credentials_pg.rs pins the seeded rows. Both gated green
# (receipts 4c2f15c5, 719b6e61), the train gate ran boss-jobs on the
# assembled tree, and all six cars aboard were struck (train 767cfb14,
# gate-run 06995f6c; backlog 4711828d). Until then a migration-only car
# ran "fixture + lints only": the fixture proves the schema APPLIES,
# and nothing proved that what it seeds still agrees with the tests
# that read it.
#
# THE PREDICATE IS THE CONSTRUCTOR, not a feature flag or a file name.
# `boss_testing::TestDb::new` (and `new_without`) is the one call that
# applies infra/postgres/schema/ to a fresh database, so a crate that
# calls it anywhere in src/ or tests/ reads every migration. Measured
# on 2026-09-16 against the alternatives: "declares a `postgres`
# feature AND has tests/*_pg.rs" names 13 crates and drops
# boss-dispatcher (no feature, stands up a TestDb in rules_wait_pg.rs)
# and eleven others whose DB tests are named differently; the
# constructor names 25 — which is the whole Pg-tested workspace, and
# that is the honest answer, not a cost to optimise away. Correctness
# over speed: a migration-only gate now runs those 25 crates instead of
# none, ~2 minutes to a workspace-shaped run.
#
# Members come from `cargo metadata --no-deps` (~0.05 s, no resolution,
# no network), so a crate outside the workspace cannot be named and a
# `-p` it produces is one cargo can satisfy. The crate name is the
# manifest's directory, the same convention `path_shapes` reads off
# `crates/<tier>/<name>/`, and `scope_self_test` refuses a name that is
# not a crate. ~0.12 s in total, once per invocation, in every mode —
# `--quick` derives no scope and never reads it, but the cost is the
# same either way and a conditional would be a second code path to
# keep honest.
#
# The member walk is ONE function taking the call to look for, because a
# second registry read through a boss_testing call arrived with the same
# shape (`dispatcher_rules_dir`, below) — one walk, two questions.

# Tree-wide pins: run on EVERY scoped gate, whatever the scope
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything above maps a changed FILE to the crates that read it. A pin
# that scans a whole TREE — `the_public_mirror_url_lives_once` walks
# infra/ and apps/web/src/, the lives-once and one-door pins walk
# crates/ — reads paths no file-level map can attribute to it, because
# no literal names them. On 2026-09-23 car 622c6944 changed one Svelte
# page, `--auto` derived web + dispatcher, and the page's hard-coded
# mirror URL was first seen by the TRAIN's gate, which ran the whole
# workspace and struck ~16 cars (train 11bda216; backlog c87ad472).
#
# Running boss-testing's whole suite on every car would close it at
# 6-10 minutes a car (measured off the gate receipts of 2026-09-26). The
# pins themselves are read-only scans that take seconds, so each one
# DECLARES itself — a `//! tree-wide pin` line in its own header, the
# one place a reader of the pin sees it — and every scoped gate runs
# the declared set. Derived from the files, never listed here (§9a). A
# pin whose crate is already in the scope rides that crate's own test
# run and is not named twice.
#
# IN ANY CRATE, AND ONE TEST AT A TIME UNDER src/ (backlog cb2157f9).
# The declaration first covered whole `tests/*.rs` files, and the pin
# that most needed it is neither: boss-gateway's
# `every_api_path_the_web_fetches_is_routed` reads apps/web/src — the
# one tree a web-only car changes — and is a unit test in the BINARY,
# beside the private route table it probes. So map car R3 added a fetch
# of /api/yard/routes, derived no crate, never ran it, and the read
# 404'd at the human door after train #718: the fifth time. A single
# test under `src/` now declares itself with a `// tree-wide pin` line
# above it, and runs as a filter on the test binary that owns it — the
# crate's bin when `src/main.rs` holds it or declares its module, else
# its lib. A filter can match nothing (a rename, a module moved), so
# `run_tree_wide_pins` refuses a named test that did not report `ok`.
# `a_tree_walk_declares_itself_tree_wide.rs` refuses a test that walks a
# top-level tree and says neither this nor why not (backlog bc978312).
#
# Prints `<crate> <selector> <name>` per line: `test:<file>` for a whole
# tests/ file (the name is the file), `lib` or `bin:<name>` for one test.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# `--auto`: derive the scope instead of stating it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The refusal above is the SAFETY half of scoping — it stops a `-p`
# that misses a crate. This is the efficiency half, and it is worth
# having on a measured basis: of 164 live branches, 74 touch no Rust
# at all, and two of the fourteen cars shipped on 2026-08-16 were in
# that class. For those, everything cargo does is dead weight — the
# lint roster and fmt are the entire useful gate, thirty seconds
# against eight to fifteen minutes.
#
# A FLAG, not the default, because bare `infra/gate.sh` is what CI
# invokes and must keep meaning "the whole workspace,
# unconditionally". A gate that quietly narrowed itself in CI would be
# the same hole as the mis-scoped `-p` that reddened a three-car train
# (a6ffcb7c), pointed the other way.
#
# THE SCHEMA IS THE SUBTLE PART. `infra/postgres/schema/**` is not a
# crate, but the shared fixture LOADS it into every DB-backed test in
# the workspace, so a schema-only change can break any of them. Until
# 2026-09-16 the answer was "fixture + lints only": the fixture proved
# the schema applied and no test that reads it ran (backlog 4711828d —
# two such cars struck a six-car train). Now `path_map` maps a schema
# change to every crate that stands up the schema (`schema_readers`),
# so a migration-only car derives a scope like any other and the
# fixture runs unscoped ahead of it as before. What remains here is the
# question the receipt asks: did the schema move at all — `schema_touched`,
# defined beside `schema_paths` above, because the `-p` refusal asks it
# too and runs first.

# Which ref is "the trunk" for deriving a branch's own commits. The
# remote-tracking main this repo actually uses, with the local branch
# and an override as fallbacks — a box whose remote is named
# differently must not silently fall through to gating nothing.

# The failure, named where the public can read it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# MEASURED 2026-09-27 (backlog 29c36336): PR #245's mirror Gate exited
# 1 and the estate recorded only `failing: Gate (infra/gate.sh, full):
# failure`. This script names the failed check twice — `GATE FAIL:` on
# stderr and the receipt ci.yml cats into the job log — and GitHub
# serves a job's log only to a repository ADMIN: the API answers 403
# "Must have admin rights" with no credential, so no BOSS reader could
# name the check and a human reproduced the lint roster by hand. A
# check-run's ANNOTATIONS are public through the same API, anonymous.
#
# So on GitHub Actions (GITHUB_ACTIONS=true, the runner's own marker)
# each failed check prints ONE workflow-command annotation:
#
#   ::error title=GATE FAIL: <name>::<first useful line> (exit N, after Ts)
#
# and a refusal prints `::error title=GATE REFUSED::<why>`.
# infra/forge/read-publish-checks.sh reads them back onto the publish
# packet's `code_scanning.failing`, per check with its message. Nowhere
# else is anything printed, and nothing is captured: off Actions this
# block is inert.
#
# THE CAP. GitHub keeps ten error annotations per step and drops the
# rest silently, and the web suite's deliberate browser-error fixtures
# spend two of them on this step (#245). Five by name, then ONE summary
# naming the rest a line each, plus at most one refusal: seven.
#
# THE FIRST USEFUL LINE is read off the check's own output, teed to a
# file only here — the log still gets every byte, live. The first line
# that MARKS a failure (a failed test, a panic, an `error:`/`ERROR`
# line, a Playwright ✘, a FAIL word — the gate-runner's excerpt markers
# in infra/gate-runner/run.sh, which read the same logs) on stdout, then
# on stderr; else the first non-blank line of stderr, then of stdout;
# else it says the check printed nothing. Clipped to 300 characters: an
# annotation is a pointer to the log, not a copy of it.

# WHAT THE PAGE SHOWED WHEN A SPEC FAILED, KEPT (backlog 4d928d0a).
#
# Dock re-gate 7b2acdc4 (2026-09-27) went red on ONE mocked spec at the
# 1.0 m test timeout, on a tree that did not touch it. Playwright had
# written what the page was showing to
# apps/web/test-results/<test>/error-context.md — the page snapshot that
# says what the spec was waiting on — and its list reporter printed only
# that file's PATH. The file lived in the gate's workspace and died with
# it, so the diagnosis rested on reproducing the red, which did not
# reproduce, and it went down as unexplained. CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis:
# capture to a file and print it on failure; a reduction made before the
# record is stored throws away the only copy.
#
# So when the web suite fails, every error context Playwright wrote
# DURING that check (newer than a marker taken before it: a local
# test-results/ from an earlier run is not this run's evidence) is
# copied whole, each under the path it came from, into ONE file beside
# the receipt, printed whole in a `::group::gate-evidence: <check>` block
# of its own — outside the check's group, so the gate-runner's excerpt
# of the check keeps its budget for Playwright's verdict — and named on
# the receipt as `evidence: {"<check>": "<absolute path>"}`. The
# gate-runner copies it onto the durable record as `fails_context`
# (bounded there, and saying so). A failure that left no context says
# that instead, so silence is never the answer.
#
# ONLY THE PAGES OF SPECS THAT FAILED (backlog a766e20d). Playwright
# writes an error context for a `test.fail` spec too — it failed as told
# and is counted PASSED — and red gate-run 5b5a04d8 (2026-09-28) kept
# four of them beside its two real timeouts, so they filled the evidence
# file, the replay and the receipt's context budget ahead of a real
# timeout's page. Playwright's own `N failed` roll-up lists exactly the
# specs whose outcome was unexpected, as `[project] › file:line:col ›
# title`, and each context names its spec as `- Location: file:line:col`.
# So the call site tees the check's output to a file (`output_to`), and
# a context whose Location the roll-up does not list is set aside — by
# name, in the log, never in silence. With no roll-up to read (a run
# killed before Playwright's epilogue, an output not captured) nothing
# tells the two apart, and every context is kept, saying so.
#
# Bracketed so the_gate_keeps_a_failed_specs_error_context.rs can lift
# the block and RUN it. Defined above write_receipt, which calls
# `evidence_json` on every path — a refusal included.

# MEASURED 2026-09-18 (backlog a26f92c4, gate 35f4ff0c): the system of
# record was rolling under a converge, so
# `the-live-protocols-are-the-authored-protocols` could not read the
# registry, and the gate went red on a car that had changed nothing the
# lint judges. CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: "an infrastructure refusal is not a
# consist failure" — recorded as one it strikes every car aboard.
#
# THE DISK FLOOR'S SHAPE, exactly: `GATE_REFUSAL` set, `write_receipt
# "refused"`, exit 2. `train_gate::standing` reads that receipt as
# `Standing::Refused` and relaunches; the yard and `red_verdict_detail`
# print `refused_because`; nothing takes a strike. Immediate, like the
# floor, rather than at the end of the roster: a machine that cannot
# answer one lint is not a machine whose other verdicts are worth
# recording as the branch's.
#
# The lint's own stderr is kept to a file so the receipt can carry its
# first refusal line — the WHY, in the lint's words, which is otherwise
# a log the runner reaps (§Diagnosis: a verdict someone must go
# re-derive is not a verdict). It is replayed to the gate's stderr after
# the lint exits, so nothing is lost, only delayed by one lint's runtime.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Running a roster
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The roster runs CONCURRENTLY, bounded, and is REPORTED in roster
# order, in two phases:
#
#   1. `roster_pool` runs every lint to a RECORD: its stdout, its stderr,
#      its exit status and its own seconds, each in a file named by the
#      lint's place in the roster. BOSS_GATE_LINT_JOBS lints at a time
#      (default 8), and the serial lane (`serial_lane` above) beside
#      them, one lint at a time.
#   2. The loop in `run_roster` walks the roster in order and hands each
#      record to the runner — `check_lint` in the gate — which replays it
#      inside the lint's own `::group::` block as if the lint had run
#      there: the same stdout, the same stderr, the same exit status and
#      the same duration (`check` records the lint's seconds, handed over
#      in CHECK_TOOK, not the instant the replay took).
#
# WHY (backlog dc5b6302). Measured 2026-09-24 on a72cd3e5 (run
# d3928d0b): fmt plus the 90 lints took 106 s one at a time, and the
# slowest single lint took 10 s. That day's 117 pre-flights spent about
# 2.3 h of builder time in this loop, and every gate spent another 55 s
# in it. Measured on this change, on the dev pod, 2026-09-25, with the
# node at a load of 34-80: `--quick` took 131.8 s with the roster run
# one lint at a time, and 23-36 s (three runs) with it run eight at a
# time — the roster itself 19-28 s of that.
#
# WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE, and each one is why the record is replayed in
# order rather than printed as it arrives:
#   - the ORDER of the report is the roster's, whatever order the lints
#     finish in, so one tree prints one log. The gate runner lifts a
#     failed check's `::group::` block into the receipt's failure detail,
#     and a lint's words are still in its own block and no one else's;
#   - NOTHING IS REDUCED. Every byte a lint prints is kept in its file
#     and replayed: stdout, then stderr. The one thing a concurrent run
#     cannot keep is how the two streams interleaved in time;
#   - a lint's exit 3 is still a REFUSAL, decided by `check_lint` on the
#     replayed status, and it still stops the run at that lint in roster
#     order. The records behind it are discarded unread, as their lints
#     used to go unrun;
#   - the COUNT still holds the run to the roster (below).
#
# THE BOUND. 8 by default, because a lint is a grep or a parse over the
# tree and nproc cannot be trusted to size it: on the dev pod it reads
# the NODE's 32 CPUs while the pod's cgroup holds 16, and a dozen
# builders may be pre-flighting on that one pod at once. The gate
# runner's container is limited to 20. Measured on the pod, 2026-09-25,
# whole `--quick` wall-clock: 25 s at 4, 23-36 s at 8, 27 s at 12, 20 s
# at 16 — inside the noise of a node at load 40-80, because the floor
# under every one of them is the slowest single lint, not the bound
# (`a-deleted-manifest-leaves-no-object`, 9-18 s in the serial lane on
# a box with kubectl, then `the-estate-address-lives-once`, 8-16 s).
# The closing line of every pre-flight names the three slowest, so the
# next reader measures this from the log. BOSS_GATE_LINT_JOBS overrides
# the bound; 1 runs the pool one lint at a time, the serial lane still
# beside it.
#
# The loop and the mechanisms that keep it from eating itself.
#
# Until 2026-09-10 this was `while read -r name path; do check "$name"
# bash "$path"; done <<< "$roster"`, which handed every lint the
# REMAINING ROSTER LINES as its stdin. Any lint that reads stdin — a
# `grep` or `awk` whose file list came out empty and so falls back to
# it, a bare `cat`, a `read` — consumed the rest of the roster. The loop
# then ended normally having run only the checks above it, and the gate
# printed `pre-flight: clean` and exited 0. MEASURED on a draft lint
# with an empty grep file list: a 61-lint roster ran NINE checks and the
# gate called it clean (backlog 9d5797d4).
#
# The irony is the point, and it is the comment the old loop carried: it
# ran `bash <path>` rather than executing the file precisely because "a
# lint that quietly could not run is the under-covering gate this roster
# exists to prevent". It guarded one way a lint silently does not run
# and introduced another.
#
# THREE mechanisms, because they fail differently:
#
#   `3<<<` / `<&3` — the ROSTER's defence. The list the loop reads is
#   not on a descriptor a child is handed by default, so no body this
#   loop ever grows can truncate it. Since the roster went concurrent no
#   lint runs inside this loop at all — `roster_pool` reads the roster
#   into two lists with builtins alone before any lint starts — so the
#   descriptor now guards the replay loop's own body, which is ours.
#
#   `< /dev/null` — the CHILD's defence. A stdin-reading lint must not
#   inherit whatever stdin the GATE got: a pipe under the runner, a
#   terminal by hand. The same lint would then read different bytes, or
#   block forever, depending on how the gate was invoked. The worker
#   below hands every lint an explicit empty stdin, so it reads EOF
#   everywhere, which is the only answer a lint can be written against.
#
#   the COUNT — the unknown mechanism's defence. A lint that left NO
#   RECORD did not run to an answer: its worker was killed, the record
#   could not be written, xargs gave up. The loop counts the records it
#   replayed against the lines the roster holds and refuses BY NAME when
#   they differ, whatever ate them. A truncation is invisible by nature;
#   this is the one check that can see it.
#
# `$runner` is `check_lint` in the gate and a recorder in the self-test
# below, so the pin exercises THIS loop rather than a copy of it
# (CLAUDE.md §9a).
#
# `bash <path>` rather than executing it, as the consist check does: a
# checkout may not carry the executable bit, and a lint that quietly
# could not run is the under-covering gate this roster exists to
# prevent.

# out the pushed commit where the file IS tracked. MEASURED 2026-09-18
# (backlog a5efc919): the H12 builder's `--quick` said clean, and gate
# a3b26113 went red on `the-estate-address-lives-once` over a manifest
# the pre-flight had never been able to see.
#
# ONE refusal here, not `--others` taught to every reader: the readers
# are many (lib/pattern-scan.sh, lib/git-answer.sh, no-secrets's own
# `ls-files -z`, and the lints nobody has written yet), the refusal is
# one place, and a builder has to `git add` the file before committing

# on it. The roots the lints scan are the WHOLE tree (`no-secrets` and
# `the-estate-address-lives-once` read every tracked path), so the
# question is exactly `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`: a
# tracked-but-modified file is read from the working copy and is fine;
# an ignored file never reaches the gate workspace either and is fine.
#

# `--lint` is `--quick` plus the one compiled check that pays for
# itself. It exists because of a measured waste: on 2026-08-28 a car
# went red on `clippy` alone, costing a gate and a re-gate — about 22
# minutes of cluster time — for two unused imports. The pre-flight had
# passed and was right to: it says in its own output that clippy is
# still unproven.
#
# David, 2026-08-28: "Inherent slowness is fine. That just incentivizes
# us to squeeze out errors around those steps to ensure they are never
# wasted." A gate takes ~11 minutes and train CI ~15; a scoped clippy
# takes seconds on a warm tree. Trading the second for the first is the
# whole argument.
#
# WORKSPACE TARGETS, INCLUDING DEPENDENTS (4669e9d7, design caa2acc9).
# A new core field can break a literal in another crate's test without
# breaking the core crate itself. Clippy must compile that consumer,
# both here and at the car gate; build and test remain scoped there.
# The path map still decides whether anything needs to compile: a
# docs, infra or apps change mapping to no crate skips clippy and says
# so. No separate workspace `cargo check` repeats this compilation.
#
# STILL NOT A GATE. The build and the test suites remain unproven, and
# a DB-backed test cannot run here at all. This narrows the red-gate
# classes by one; it does not replace the gate.
#
# THE SCOPE SELF-TEST RUNS HERE TOO, first, because it is the gate's
# first act on `--auto` and needs no build. Until 2026-09-23 it ran only
# on the gate's own paths, so a stale case in it passed `--lint` twice
# and then red gate-run 1f412b9e before any check ran, leaving no
# receipt (backlog d8637703). It exits 2 naming the case, as the gate
# does — and ahead of `crates_from_paths`, the map it checks, because
# the clippy scope below is derived from that map.
#
# ONLY WHERE THERE IS A WORKSPACE for the map to name. The self-test
# checks its cases against this tree's crates and `cargo metadata`, so on
# a tree with no Cargo.toml — the synthetic trees boss-testing drives
# this script in — every case fails for want of a crate, not for a stale
# map. It says so rather than skipping in silence; the repo always has
# one, so here the check always runs.
