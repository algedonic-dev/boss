// sign-off.js v3 — the surface for a step that needs someone's name on
// a DECISION, showing them what they are deciding.
//
// v1 (car 884b85f4's train) rendered the stamp ceremony — the role
// roster, who signed when, stale-stamp 409s — and nothing else. That
// solved "Missing custom step UX" (b1aa1f5f) for ceremony steps and
// then, because a plugin evicts the platform surface for its whole
// KIND, blinded every decision-shaped sign-off in the system:
// 19db52de, David on his publish approval, "There is just a sign and
// complete button, which doesn't seem like much of a choice." The row
// was retired live on 2026-08-19; this version earns it back.
//
// What a sign-off step actually carries, all now rendered:
//   1. THE CASE — step.metadata.context_md, else the job's context_md,
//      else the job's filed message (the DecisionContext chain; a
//      plugin is exempt from the host panel, so it folds in here).
//   2. THE CONTRACT — step.fields declares required-at-done metadata
//      (publish-to-github v3 requires `approved`); v1 offered a
//      Complete that could only 400 against these, and did not show
//      the 400. Declared fields render as inputs, enums as selects,
//      and the decision buttons stay disabled until required ones are
//      filled — a button that exists only to produce an error teaches
//      the operator to distrust buttons (v1's own line, kept).
//   3. THE DECISION — Approve / Reject / Request changes, writing the
//      decision trio (`decision`, `decided_at`, `comment`) exactly as
//      the platform ApprovalSurface does, so protocol predicates read
//      one vocabulary regardless of which surface recorded it.
//   4. THE CEREMONY — v1's roster, verbatim in behavior: stamps are
//      collected per role, the step cannot complete while one is
//      outstanding, and a 409 surfaces the server's stale-roles text.
//   5. WHAT THE PASSKEY SIGNS — on a presence step, the title and EVERY
//      metadata key, drawn from the step's own keys (design f623e425
//      D3; backlog 6c9183de extends b and c, 2026-09-25). The passkey
//      binds step_shape_hash(title, metadata), and this surface drew
//      only the declared fields, so an ops-request's verb, host, args,
//      rendered_plan_sha256 or a planted decision was signed by the
//      per-role button unseen. A ceremony on a step whose block is not
//      drawn — a kind whose floor demands presence the step never
//      declared — signs nothing: it draws the block and asks for the
//      tap again. Title, key names and values are drawn AS THEIR BYTES —
//      quoted and escaped wherever a reader could otherwise misread them
//      (backlog 6093cf13) — a box that scrolls says so, and an unmounted
//      surface signs nothing.
//
// Order on Approve/Reject (v3, feedback 221b4b5c): metadata lands
// first (a stamp attests the step's current shape, so the decision
// must be IN the shape), then the user's own stamp if their role is
// required and unsigned, then the completion — skipped, with a plain
// explanation, while other roles' signatures are still outstanding.
// Request changes records without completing — unless the step's
// protocol declares `changes_requested_completes = true`, when it takes
// the Approve path (backlog da322e8f). NOTHING writes metadata
// after a signature exists: on 2026-09-05 15:40 David signed, then
// this surface re-saved his unchanged decision with a fresh
// decided_at, and the completion answered 409 stale two seconds after
// his signature. A decision that a signature already covers is not
// re-saved; one that changes is saved BEFORE the (re-)signature, and
// the roster says which stamps that made stale. Each stage of the
// gesture is shown as it lands — saved, signed, completed — and any
// refusal verbatim, so a tap never looks like it did nothing.
//
// Plugin contract: window.__boss_register_step_plugin(kind, mount);
// mount(container, { step, jobId, onUpdate, currentUser }).
