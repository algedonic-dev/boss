# seed-brewery-tenant.sh — publish the brewery tenant onto a running
# BOSS stack via the converged prepare step: classes, JobKinds, tenant
# policy grants, and the seed data (operators / employees / accounts /
# vendors / messages / FG + raw + asset opening balances), then stamp
# the reset baseline. The seeding is one `boss-brewery-sim prepare`
# call (the prepare_model lib fn) so this path and the offline regen
# drive identical code instead of drifting.
#
# Called by both quickstart launchers (bare-metal bootstrap-local.sh
# and docker services-launcher.sh) just before the brewery sim starts.
# None of this is carried by the audit_log any more — the demo builds
# itself live from an empty log — so the live sim needs these entities
# to exist up front or its job/invoice posts 404 and the playground
# sits idle.
#
# Binaries are PATH-resolved: docker ships them in /usr/local/bin;
# bare-metal callers prepend target/release. Idempotent — safe to
# re-run. Event time on the seeded rows is pinned to the demo epoch
# (BOSS_DEMO_EPOCH_START) so they land on day 0, not wall-time.

# Seed the whole brewery tenant model — classes, JobKinds, policy
# grants, and data (operators / employees / accounts / vendors /
# messages / FG + raw + asset opening balances) — through the public
# API in one call. `boss-brewery-sim prepare` drives the converged
# prepare_model lib fn (classes → JobKinds → policy → data), routing
# to each service's own port. Retry while the stack finishes binding
# (the launcher calls this the moment it reaches the sim in its start
# order). Idempotent + retry-safe: each sub-step skips rows that
# already exist, so a retry after a transient bind failure resumes
# cleanly. BOSS_SIM_SEEDS_DIR points at the tenant bundle;
# BOSS_EPOCH_START pins seeded event time to the demo epoch (the
# seeder rebases the clock to (epoch − 1 day) internally).
# Wait for every service prepare writes through to be reachable before
# seeding. On a cold stack the ~24 services take 30-90s to finish binding +
# startup reconciliation; prepare hard-fails on the first unreachable core
# service (classes/jobs/policy/people/accounts) and silently SKIPS the
# base_reachable-guarded optional seeds (catalog/assets/FG), leaving a
# half-seeded, idle demo. Gating on health up front lets prepare run once
# against a fully-up stack instead of racing it. Ports come from
# boss-ports-list (the canonical table shared with the binaries), so a port
# rename lands here for free. Install-only path (Playwright seeds via
# boss-brewery-data-seed, not this script), so waiting for every service is
# always correct here. Degrades to a no-op if the tooling is absent.
