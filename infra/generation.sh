#       bin/                 HEAD short sha: service + helper binaries
#       web-dist/            the SPA bundle (rolls back with the code)
#       step-plugins/        step-plugin JS bundles
#       .boss-src-fingerprint  stamp of the sources the bins came from
#     current -> releases/<sha>    the live generation (atomic flip)
#     previous -> releases/<sha>   the one before it (revert target)
#     state/
#       deploy-confirm.pending   marker armed at flip, cleared by the
#                                confirm verdict (boss-deploy-confirm)

#
# Units exec through the symlink (ExecStart=/usr/local/boss/current/
# bin/<name>), and every /usr/local/bin/boss-* the deploy manages is a
# symlink through `current` too — so one flip re-points binaries, web
# dist and step-plugins together, and a revert is seconds, not a build.
