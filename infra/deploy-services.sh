#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Unified deploy script for the Boss API services.
#
# Replaces deploy-scratch-services.sh and the scattered per-service
# setup.sh files. One data table, two environments:
#
#   sudo ./infra/deploy-services.sh prod
#   sudo ./infra/deploy-services.sh scratch
#   sudo ./infra/deploy-services.sh both
#
# Services:
#   - Paired (prod + scratch): shipping, messages, inventory,
#     commerce, people, assets, catalog, calendar, jobs. These share
#     a DB + NATS and the scratch variant runs on +1000 ports
#     against boss_scratch.
#   - Solo (prod only): sim, ml, docs. No scratch variants (sim is
#     the scratch driver; ml/docs are read-only stateless consumers).
#
# Per run the script:
#   1. Writes /etc/boss-<name>-api[-scratch].toml
#   2. Writes /etc/systemd/system/boss-<name>-api[-scratch].service
#   3. systemctl daemon-reload
#   4. Stages binaries (+ carried web-dist / step-plugins) into a
#      generation at /usr/local/boss/releases/<sha>/
#   5. Converges the schema on the target database(s) —
#      infra/postgres/migrate.sh, manifest order, idempotent. Runs
#      before the flip, so a migration error aborts the deploy with
#      nothing activated and nothing restarted.
#   6. Atomically flips the `current` symlink (previous generation stays
#      on disk as the revert target — see infra/generation.sh)
#   7. systemctl enable + restart each unit (units exec through the
#      `current` symlink), arms boss-deploy-confirm, prunes to the 3
#      newest generations (logging what was pruned, with sizes)
#   8. Probes /api/<name>/health and reports the status code
#
# Idempotent — safe to re-run. Re-deploying the sha that is already
# live re-activates the standing generation (stage is skipped when the
# build stamp matches) and restarts; it never clobbers a live
# generation mid-copy — staging is a dot-dir, activation is one rename.
#
# Modes beyond deploy:
#
#   sudo ./infra/deploy-services.sh check prod|scratch|both
#       diff generated configs/units against disk, write nothing
#   ./infra/deploy-services.sh probe [prod|scratch|both]
#       strict health probes — exit 1 on any failure. This is the
#       roster boss-deploy-confirm evaluates, so the confirm cannot
#       drift from the deploy list (defaults to prod).
#   sudo ./infra/deploy-services.sh revert
#       flip current <-> previous and restart the prod fleet — the
#       make-before-break rollback (seconds, no build)
#   sudo ./infra/deploy-services.sh prune
#       prune the generation store to the newest 3, printing sizes

# Services connect directly to PG :5432. The roster has grown to ~24
# services × sqlx pool-10, so the cluster runs with max_connections=400
# (raised from PG's default 100 via `ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections`).
# At the default 100 a high-warp regen compresses a sim-year of writes
# into minutes, every pool tries to fill at once, policy-api gets starved
# of DB connections, and jobs-api fail-closes its policy checks (403
# policy-unreachable) — which the JetStream redelivery layer then
# amplifies into sustained saturation. 400 gives the pools room so the
# contention stays in the transient-blip regime redelivery is built for.
# A pgbouncer-in-front-of-PG layer was prototyped + removed pre-v0.1 (the
# isolation pays off at much larger concurrency than this has; the SCRAM
# image + statement-cache compatibility surface isn't worth carrying).

#
# Measured 2026-08-17: the conductor invokes this script as
# `sudo -n .../deploy-services.sh prod`, and sudo strips the
# environment. boss-train.service carries
# BOSS_JOBS_URL=http://10.20.0.34:7900, that value never reached here,
# and the timer drop-in was written with the local default instead. So
# every nightly maintenance packet still filed against the demo
# instance — the wiring was repo-borne and visible, and still pointed
# at the wrong database.
#
# `set -a` so plain `KEY=value` lines export without each needing the
# word `export`, which is what makes this a config file rather than a
# shell script someone has to get right. Absent file = defaults hold,
# which is correct for a fresh box and for a deploy running ON the
# cluster, where the SoR is localhost.

# Freshness PRE-FLIGHT — check everything before installing anything.
#
# Two defects, both found on 2026-08-08, both fixed here.
#
# 1. `install_binary` used to `exit 1` the moment it met a stale
#    binary, from INSIDE the install loop. That aborted the deploy
#    partway: some binaries already written to /usr/local/bin, none of
#    the services restarted, and the run ending on a line that reads
#    like a note rather than a failure. It installed ten binaries, hit
#    a stale one, and stopped — leaving new code on disk with
#    five-hour-old processes still serving it, while having printed
#    `installed boss-jobs-api` for each. The mismatch took an hour to
#    find because nothing said "aborted". So: validate first, act
#    second. Either every binary is good and the deploy runs end to
#    end, or nothing is touched.
#
# 2. The check itself compared MTIMES, which git rewrites. A rebase or
#    a branch switch restamps every file it rewrites, so a clean tree
#    whose binaries were built from exactly that content was reported
#    stale — demanding a 50-minute rebuild for byte-identical output.
#    Now it compares a content fingerprint recorded by the build; see
#    infra/src-fingerprint.sh.

# The train's deploy verb (boss-cli, `train.rs`) already runs migrate.sh
# before calling this script, so on that path this is a no-op that says
# so; a deploy driven by hand (`sudo ./infra/deploy-services.sh prod`,
# bootstrap-vm.sh step 8) had no schema step at all, and would happily
# restart new code against an old database. The cluster had exactly that
# gap on 2026-08-13 and shipped a 500 (`relation "stations" does not
# exist`) off a deploy that reported success.
#
# Placed before the generation flip on purpose: a migration failure then
# leaves the box completely untouched — old code still serving the
# database it was built for — which is the correct state after a failed
# deploy, the same property the fingerprint pre-flight above protects.
#
# migrate.sh is idempotent by ledger (only manifest entries missing from
# schema_migrations apply, each atomically with its bookkeeping row) and
# it prints what it applied plus an `applied N, already recorded M, of K
# manifest entries` summary. Failures are NOT swallowed: a half-migrated
# database that keeps serving is worse than a visible failure.
