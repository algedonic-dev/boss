# Canonical release build for deploy. Run this before infra/deploy-services.sh.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Most service crates are `default = []` so their fast in-memory adapter is
# the default for tests. Two traps follow, and they bite every deploy:
#
#   1. `cargo build --release --workspace` silently produces *in-memory*
#      binaries for those crates (the postgres adapter is never compiled in).
#      Such a binary exit-1s on startup — or worse, serves an in-memory store
#      that loses every write — and nothing warns you at build time.
#
#   2. Each service binary gates its bin target behind its own
#      `required-features`: usually `postgres`, but some carry an umbrella
#      `<service>-api` feature (e.g. accounts-api = ["postgres", ...],
#      events-api = ["bin"]). `cargo build -p X --features postgres` *errors
#      or silently no-ops* when the real gate is `accounts-api`.
#
# Hand-maintaining a list of "which crates need --features what" drifts
# instantly (deploy-services.sh's NEEDS_POSTGRES_FEATURE listed 7 of 17).
# So this script asks cargo: for every bin target that declares
# `required-features`, build it with exactly those. No list to maintain.
#
# Multi-package `--features` is also unreliable (it skips some packages), so
# each gated bin is built in its own invocation.
#
# Usage:
#   ./infra/build-release.sh            # build everything for deploy
#   ./infra/build-release.sh --verify   # also assert each gated bin links sqlx

# NO mtime stamping. This used to `touch` every binary here, to stop the
# freshness guard false-flagging a bin cargo had skipped as "older than the
# newest source". The premise — after a clean run every binary is current,
# because cargo either rebuilt it or confirmed it — holds only while the tree
# does not move DURING the run.
#
# On 2026-08-07 it moved. A source edit landed mid-build, after phase 1 had
# already compiled that crate; the touch then stamped the resulting binary
# "current" and the guard passed it. The change (a sim granularity fix) was
# silently absent on a running box while the sim fell behind its own clock,
# and only `sha256` against a fresh build found it.
#
# The touch turned a conservative wrong answer into a confident wrong one, and
# those cost differently: a false STALE costs a rebuild, a false "fresh" costs
# an incident. So a skipped bin may now read STALE. That is the safe
# direction, and `check-binary-freshness.sh --rebuild` settles it for real —
# cargo is the only thing that actually knows.

# Stamp what this build was made from. `set -euo pipefail` is on, so
# reaching this line means every cargo invocation above succeeded — the
# stamp cannot outlive a failed build.
#
# The deploy compares this against the working tree instead of
# comparing mtimes, because git rewrites mtimes on every checkout and
# rebase; see infra/src-fingerprint.sh for the incident.
#
# The stamp failing IS a build failure: unstamped (or stale-stamped)
# binaries cannot be verified against the tree, and the deploy
# pre-flight will refuse them later with a far less useful message.
# This line carried `|| true` and lived up to it on 2026-08-08 — a
# root-owned stale stamp survived a sudo-era build, this script said
# "complete", and the mismatch surfaced only at deploy time.
