//! THE FRESH INSTANCE'S SEED PATH, RUN ON AN EMPTY DATABASE (backlog
//! 0d2d7daa, 2026-09-16; design e652c7c6 Option 3 — David: "make sure
//! we have our seeding setup properly for our new, real instance").
//!
//! What runs here is what the pod runs: the schema on an empty TestDb,
//! the REAL people router (`PgPeople`), the REAL locations router
//! (`PgLocations`), the REAL agents router (`PgAgents`, over the
//! migration-registered `agent-claude`) and the REAL policy router
//! (`PgPolicy`, after the same default-rule reconcile boss-policy-api
//! runs at boot) on one ephemeral port, then the shipped `boss`
//! binary's `tenant publish
//! --gateway` against a verbatim copy of the real company's tenant
//! directory (tests/fixtures/tenant-algedonic, its HEAD 20f3a9e — no
//! secrets: the manifest says so and a grep agrees), then the
//! operator-baseline seed's library entry
//! (`boss_people::operator_baseline::seed`, the binary's whole body)
//! with BOSS_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL set to the founder's address, in
//! the order tenant-launch.sh now runs them for a tenant with no
//! engine.
//!
//! Then the database is read back: ONE row holds the founder's email
//! and it is `emp-david`, not `emp-bootstrap-admin`; `emp-david` is
//! the deployment's platform-admin (the tenant's decision, 2026-09-16:
//! "only David Auld as the Platform Admin" — the role core's default
//! rules already grant everything to, so the file grants nothing and
//! the policy engine still allows him); `emp-audit` landed.
//!
//! WHAT THIS PROOF STOPS SHORT OF, BY NAME. The four other doors —
//! classes, calendars, the company Subject, and the Workflows — answer
//! from a stub here: the jobs API's design-Job walk needs the whole
//! platform bundle and is proven by boss-jobs' own tests and the
//! stub-level tests in src/tenant_publish.rs; the stub answers the
//! workflow kind as already operator-published so the door SKIPS, the
//! way a second publish does. `receive-a-sponsorship active` is
//! therefore NOT asserted here (follow-up: a jobs-router harness).
//!
//! WHAT IT FOUND, AND WHAT CLOSED IT. On 2026-09-16 the real tenant's
//! founder declared `location = "loc-algedonic-hq"` and no door seeded
//! a tenant's locations — `employees.location` is a foreign key into
//! a registry only the schema filled — so run verbatim the publish
//! was REFUSED at employees.json naming the location (the first case
//! pinned that refusal loud; it used to be a 409 swallowed as "already
//! there"), and the tenant worked around it by sitting the founder at
//! the platform's `loc-hq`. Backlog 1ec8312a (2026-09-17) added the
//! door: `POST /api/locations/batch`, sent by `boss tenant publish`
//! BEFORE the roster. The first case now proves the verbatim tenant
//! lands and that the location is there before the employee — the
//! foreign key is the machine's own proof of the order. Backlog
//! f56155f0 (same day) added the agents seed: the same case proves the
//! tenant's `agent-claude` meets the migration's row and — since
//! design e187198f (2026-09-18: THE INSTANCE IS THE TRUTH) — is KEPT
//! with each differing field named, then UPDATED to the declaration
//! only under `--take agents`, each change named from → to; never a
//! silent "already there": the fixture's agents.toml is the contract's
//! shape, which is the real tenant's @ 20f3a9e minus the `role` and
//! `department` the registry cannot hold (check refuses those by
//! name). The third case runs the rule at the people door: a changed
//! employees.json is kept and named by default, applied under `--take
//! employees` (the founder's declared field moves, a column the file
//! does not declare is kept, one `people.employee.updated`), and a
//! re-run writes nothing. The second case also pins emp-audit as REAL: the baseline
//! seed carried `x-sim-origin: true` from the initial commit, which
//! made the platform's own auditor prod's one simulated employee.
