//! `boss triage` / `boss fold` / `boss hold` / `boss release` — the
//! step writes an operator kept hand-building, with the body READ off
//! the step's own declared fields instead of typed from memory.
//!
//! WHY. Retro 27fad542 counted ten hand-built `boss-api PUT
//! /api/jobs/{id}/steps/{sid}` calls in two days (window
//! 2026-09-16T23:55Z to 09-18T14:00Z): three triage dispositions on
//! backlog-items, three design-doc fold steps, one decision packet's
//! build step, and three or four review-step holds and releases on
//! parked cars (backlog 0d2e1655). Every one carried a body typed from
//! memory of the step's field names — `disposition`, `evidence`,
//! `fold_change`, `hold` — the retro's own class B, a value typed
//! instead of read. A field name typed wrong does not error: the API
//! merges the body over the step and stores an unknown key as an
//! annotation, while the required one stays missing until
//! required-at-done refuses it — or, on a step with nothing required,
//! never. `boss job file` and `boss gate` retired the same class of
//! curl for filing; these retire it for completing.
//!
//! THE BODY IS READ, NOT TYPED. A materialised step carries the
//! `fields` its Workflow row declared, at the version the packet is
//! pinned to — the very list `update_step` validates a completion
//! against (`validate_authored_fields(&step.fields, ..)`). Each verb
//! reads that list off the packet and refuses what the row does not
//! declare: a disposition outside the enum is refused NAMING the enum;
//! `--evidence` lands in whichever text field the row declares
//! (`evidence` on a backlog-item, `finding` on user-feedback) and is
//! refused when the row declares neither; a fold on a doc whose review
//! is not done is refused naming the anchors still open. The one key
//! no row declares is `hold`: it is a MARKER, read by
//! `boss_jobs::stranded::hold_reason` on the car's review step, and
//! written here in exactly that shape — a non-blank string to hold,
//! the key removed to release.
//!
//! CONFIRMATION OVER STATUS CODES, as `boss job patch` does. Every
//! write reads the packet back and fails unless the step holds what
//! was sent, then prints where the packet stands NOW — the next open
//! step and who holds it — because that is the question the operator
//! asked next, by hand, every time.
//!
//! Signed as the actor running the verb (`identity`), never the
//! conductor (5083d6f5): an unnamed write is refused before it goes.

// `boss step complete` — the generic completion.
//
// WHY (backlog d7d28a54). The five verbs above cover five step kinds.
// Every other completion is a hand-built `boss-api PUT
// /api/jobs/{id}/steps/{sid}` whose body must be read off the packet
// first, and the page march is about to ask for ~94 of them (47 routes
// x `measure` + `file`). The three hazards that PUT carries are all in
// `boss-jobs/src/http/steps.rs`: `metadata` is REPLACED wholesale by
// the body's top-level keys, so a naive completion would delete the
// step's `procedure` and its `agent` block — since e39a9d2a the PUT
// refuses such a body (409, naming the dropped keys), and the decided
// end state refuses ANY metadata body, so the fields go through the
// step merge door and the PUT carries the status alone
// (`Wire::complete_step`);
// an UNKNOWN field name is not refused but
// stored beside the real ones, so a name typed from memory reads as
// success and records nothing (retro 27fad542, class B); and a 204 is
// a claim, not a fact.

// WHY (backlog e871febf). The clock rule
// `an-abandoned-step-is-reclaimed-when-its-run-died` frees a claimed
// step by asking whether the run NAMED ON IT died — and a step that
// carries no `agent_run` edge is, correctly, left alone forever:
// nothing names its executor, so nothing there can tell abandoned from
// busy. That is exactly the population the rule was written for. On
// 2026-09-19 a session orphaned fifteen runs, twelve of them holding a
// step that was built, gated green and never handed back; the edge
// only began being written that day (dd6d44b7), so those steps carry
// none. Measured on the live board 2026-09-22: of twenty claimed
// agent-workable steps, three carry no edge and have stood since the
// 19th. Small — which is why this is a VERB and not a sweep. A sweep
// is a hand that leaves nothing behind; a verb is a door the next
// operator finds when a step is stuck for a reason no rule covers.
//
// IT IS A HAND, AND IT SAYS SO. The clock rule records `reclaimed`
// with the death it measured. This records `released` with the reason
// a person gave, under a different key, because the two are different
// claims about the record: one is evidence, the other is testimony.
