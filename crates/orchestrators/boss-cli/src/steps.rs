//! `boss triage` / `boss fold` / `boss hold` / `boss release` — the
//! step writes an operator kept hand-building, with the body READ off
//! the step's own declared fields instead of typed from memory.
//!
//! WHY. Retro 27fad542 counted ten hand-built `boss-api PUT
//! /api/jobs/{id}/steps/{sid}` calls in two days (window
//! 2026-09-16T23:55Z to 09-18T14:00Z): three triage dispositions on
//! backlog-items, three design-doc fold steps, one decision packet's
//! build step, and three or four review-step holds and releases on
//! parked cars (backlog 0d2e1655). Every one carried a body typed from
//! memory of the step's field names — `disposition`, `evidence`,
//! `fold_change`, `hold` — the retro's own class B, a value typed
//! instead of read. A field name typed wrong does not error: the API
//! merges the body over the step and stores an unknown key as an
//! annotation, while the required one stays missing until
//! required-at-done refuses it — or, on a step with nothing required,
//! never. `boss job file` and `boss gate` retired the same class of
//! curl for filing; these retire it for completing.
//!
//! THE BODY IS READ, NOT TYPED. A materialised step carries the
//! `fields` its Workflow row declared, at the version the packet is
//! pinned to — the very list `update_step` validates a completion
//! against (`validate_authored_fields(&step.fields, ..)`). Each verb
//! reads that list off the packet and refuses what the row does not
//! declare: a disposition outside the enum is refused NAMING the enum;
//! `--evidence` lands in whichever text field the row declares
//! (`evidence` on a backlog-item, `finding` on user-feedback) and is
//! refused when the row declares neither; a fold on a doc whose review
//! is not done is refused naming the anchors still open. The one key
//! no row declares is `hold`: it is a MARKER, read by
//! `boss_jobs::stranded::hold_reason` on the car's review step, and
//! written here in exactly that shape — a non-blank string to hold,
//! the key removed to release.
//!
//! CONFIRMATION OVER STATUS CODES, as `boss job patch` does. Every
//! write reads the packet back and fails unless the step holds what
//! was sent, then prints where the packet stands NOW — the next open
//! step and who holds it — because that is the question the operator
//! asked next, by hand, every time.
//!
//! Signed as the actor running the verb (`identity`), never the
//! conductor (5083d6f5): an unnamed write is refused before it goes.
