//! `boss prove <car>` — proof is a receipt, not a claim.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The `gate` step is trustworthy because a machine
//! writes its receipt and `boss park` copies it verbatim; nobody types
//! a verdict. The `proven` step had no such thing. Its one required
//! field, `verified`, is free prose, so "proven in prod" meant only
//! that somebody wrote a sentence saying so.
//!
//! That is not a hypothetical weakness. On 2026-08-28 a change was
//! reported done on the strength of an HTTP 204 — the API accepted a
//! write, so the write was called proof — and the behaviour it claimed
//! had never been observed. Twice. David's question was the right one:
//! how is there evidence a fix is in prod before coming back to me?
//! The answer was that there wasn't, because nothing required any.
//!
//! WORSE, THE HAND-ROLLED CHECKS WERE THEMSELVES WRONG. The same day, a
//! verification loop used `grep -c ... || echo 0`; on no match that
//! prints `0` from grep AND `0` from the fallback, and the resulting
//! "0\n0" compared unequal to "0", so the loop reported success for a
//! file that had not changed. A check written fresh per change is a
//! second thing that can be broken, and it is broken silently, in the
//! direction of saying yes.
//!
//! SO THE VERB RUNS THE PROBE ITSELF. It does not accept output pasted
//! in; it executes the command, captures exit status and both streams
//! verbatim, and REFUSES to record anything unless the probe exits zero
//! and — unless the caller explicitly downgrades to `--exit-only` —
//! unless the expected string is actually present. What lands on the
//! step is what happened, not what was hoped.
//!
//! A NUMERIC EXPECTATION IS COMPARED AS A WHOLE TOKEN. `--expect "1"`
//! once accepted a probe that printed `10`, because the comparison was
//! a plain substring test (421b3032): the claim was true and the proof
//! checked nothing, which is the one failure this verb exists to
//! prevent. Numbers now have to stand alone, and recording a bare
//! number warns and names the shape that cannot lie — assert inside the
//! probe and print a unique token.
//!
//! AND THE PROOF STAYS RE-RUNNABLE. The command is recorded alongside
//! its output, so `boss prove <car> --recheck` re-executes it later and
//! says whether the claim still holds. A proof that has silently
//! decayed — a ConfigMap preview reverted by the next converge, exactly
//! the failure `push-step-plugins.sh` warns about — becomes findable
//! instead of being a sentence in a closed packet that nobody rereads.
//!
//! WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not judge whether the
//! probe is a good probe. `--probe 'true' --exit-only` will pass, and
//! it will pass legibly: the recorded proof shows a caller who asserted
//! nothing, which is a thing a reader can see and challenge. The prose
//! in `verified` stays human, because what a change MEANS is judgement.
//! Only the evidence under it is mechanised.

/// is CLAUDE.md §9a in its behavioural form, so the predicates are now
/// `boss_jobs::probe` and both doors call them.
///
/// WHY IT REFUSES RATHER THAN WARNS. The operator IS present, and may
/// have a reason the check cannot see — which is an argument for a
/// warning until you notice `--recheck`: it re-runs this recorded probe
/// later, when nobody is watching, so a probe admitted by hand BECOMES
/// an unattended one. A refusal with a stated override keeps both — the
/// operator gets through, and the next reader learns it was overridden
/// and why.
///
/// AND WHY ONLY ONE OF THE TWO RULES REFUSES HERE. They are not the same
/// kind of rule. "Can this text run where it is going" is host-relative:
/// `host-absent-tools.txt` is a measurement of the FORGE, because a
/// `--park-probe` runs there, while this verb runs the probe HERE, in
/// front of the operator, one second later — and a pod-local `kubectl`
/// proof is the established shape for a claim only the cluster can show
/// (memory: proof probes from the pod). Refusing that would block
/// exactly the case where a human must prove what the forge cannot, so a
/// hand `--probe` is not judged against another machine's tools: the
/// question the manifest predicts, this verb measures. "Can its answer
/// be trusted" is host-independent, and refuses everywhere.
///
/// `--from-car` is the one path where both apply, because that text has
/// a second destination: the arrival rule runs it on the forge. There
/// the mismatch is NAMED and not refused — proving it by hand here is
/// the right move; what needs fixing is the probe the car recorded.
///
/// AND WHY THE TWO SHAPE CHECKS ONLY WARN (backlog 4fccc595). They are
/// host-independent like the unidentified read, so they are checked on
/// every probe at every door a person is standing at — but they are said,
/// not refused, and the reason is the DIRECTION OF THE LIE. An
/// unidentified read fails OPEN: the probe passes, the absence assertion
/// is green against a world it was never allowed to see, and a car closes
/// on a proof of nothing. A `jq -e` whose success branch is `empty`, and
/// a bare `|| exit n`, fail CLOSED: `judge` records nothing on a nonzero
/// exit, so the worst they can do is strand a car and misdescribe why —
/// which is exactly what they did for 18 hours, and which a line of text
/// in front of the operator fixes. Both detectors are also deliberately
/// coarse text scans (`boss_jobs::probe` says where they are wrong), and
