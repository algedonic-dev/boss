//! `boss prove <car>` — proof is a receipt, not a claim.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The `gate` step is trustworthy because a machine
//! writes its receipt and `boss park` copies it verbatim; nobody types
//! a verdict. The `proven` step had no such thing. Its one required
//! field, `verified`, is free prose, so "proven in prod" meant only
//! that somebody wrote a sentence saying so.
//!
//! That is not a hypothetical weakness. On 2026-08-28 a change was
//! reported done on the strength of an HTTP 204 — the API accepted a
//! write, so the write was called proof — and the behaviour it claimed
//! had never been observed. Twice. David's question was the right one:
//! how is there evidence a fix is in prod before coming back to me?
//! The answer was that there wasn't, because nothing required any.
//!
//! WORSE, THE HAND-ROLLED CHECKS WERE THEMSELVES WRONG. The same day, a
//! verification loop used `grep -c ... || echo 0`; on no match that
//! prints `0` from grep AND `0` from the fallback, and the resulting
//! "0\n0" compared unequal to "0", so the loop reported success for a
//! file that had not changed. A check written fresh per change is a
//! second thing that can be broken, and it is broken silently, in the
//! direction of saying yes.
//!
//! SO THE VERB RUNS THE PROBE ITSELF. It does not accept output pasted
//! in; it executes the command, captures exit status and both streams
//! verbatim, and REFUSES to record anything unless the probe exits zero
//! and — unless the caller explicitly downgrades to `--exit-only` —
//! unless the expected string is actually present. What lands on the
//! step is what happened, not what was hoped.
//!
//! A NUMERIC EXPECTATION IS COMPARED AS A WHOLE TOKEN. `--expect "1"`
//! once accepted a probe that printed `10`, because the comparison was
//! a plain substring test (421b3032): the claim was true and the proof
//! checked nothing, which is the one failure this verb exists to
//! prevent. Numbers now have to stand alone, and recording a bare
//! number warns and names the shape that cannot lie — assert inside the
//! probe and print a unique token.
//!
//! AND THE PROOF STAYS RE-RUNNABLE. The command is recorded alongside
//! its output, so `boss prove <car> --recheck` re-executes it later and
//! says whether the claim still holds. A proof that has silently
//! decayed — a ConfigMap preview reverted by the next converge, exactly
//! the failure a hand-pushed step-plugin bundle used to warn about — becomes findable
//! instead of being a sentence in a closed packet that nobody rereads.
//!
//! WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not judge whether the
//! probe is a good probe. `--probe 'true' --exit-only` will pass, and
//! it will pass legibly: the recorded proof shows a caller who asserted
//! nothing, which is a thing a reader can see and challenge. The prose
//! in `verified` stays human, because what a change MEANS is judgement.
//! Only the evidence under it is mechanised.

/// WHICH PROBES THIS DOOR WILL RUN (backlog 23b2dffa).
///
/// TWO DOORS RUN A CAR'S RECORDED PROBE AND ONLY ONE CHECKED IT. `boss
/// gate --park-probe` refuses a probe that names a tool the forge host
/// lacks, and one that reads the system of record unidentified. This
/// verb — the HAND door onto the same text, and the one an operator
/// reaches for while moving fast — applied neither, and the only trace
/// of the rule here was a comment describing the gate's refusal. One
/// rule, two enforcement sites, one of which is prose about the other,
/// is CLAUDE.md §9a in its behavioural form, so the predicates are now
/// `boss_jobs::probe` and both doors call them.
///
/// WHY IT REFUSES RATHER THAN WARNS. The operator IS present, and may
/// have a reason the check cannot see — which is an argument for a
/// warning until you notice `--recheck`: it re-runs this recorded probe
/// later, when nobody is watching, so a probe admitted by hand BECOMES
/// an unattended one. A refusal with a stated override keeps both — the
/// operator gets through, and the next reader learns it was overridden
/// and why.
///
/// AND WHY ONLY ONE OF THE TWO RULES REFUSES HERE. They are not the same
/// kind of rule. "Can this text run where it is going" is host-relative:
/// `host-absent-tools.txt` is a measurement of the FORGE, because a
/// `--park-probe` runs there, while this verb runs the probe HERE, in
/// front of the operator, one second later — and a pod-local `kubectl`
/// proof is the established shape for a claim only the cluster can show
/// (memory: proof probes from the pod). Refusing that would block
/// exactly the case where a human must prove what the forge cannot, so a
/// hand `--probe` is not judged against another machine's tools: the
/// question the manifest predicts, this verb measures. "Can its answer
/// be trusted" is host-independent, and refuses everywhere.
///
/// `--from-car` is the one path where both apply, because that text has
/// a second destination: the arrival rule runs it on the forge. There
/// the mismatch is NAMED and not refused — proving it by hand here is
/// the right move; what needs fixing is the probe the car recorded.
///
/// AND WHY THE TWO SHAPE CHECKS ONLY WARN (backlog 4fccc595). They are
/// host-independent like the unidentified read, so they are checked on
/// every probe at every door a person is standing at — but they are said,
/// not refused, and the reason is the DIRECTION OF THE LIE. An
/// unidentified read fails OPEN: the probe passes, the absence assertion
/// is green against a world it was never allowed to see, and a car closes
/// on a proof of nothing. A `jq -e` whose success branch is `empty`, and
/// a bare `|| exit n`, fail CLOSED: `judge` records nothing on a nonzero
/// exit, so the worst they can do is strand a car and misdescribe why —
/// which is exactly what they did for 18 hours, and which a line of text
/// in front of the operator fixes. Both detectors are also deliberately
/// coarse text scans (`boss_jobs::probe` says where they are wrong), and
/// a refusal cannot be spent that cheaply: a false refusal blocks a
/// correct probe, while a false warning costs a line someone ignores.
///
/// The SAME two warnings are said by `boss gate --park-probe`
/// (`ParkIntent::probe_warnings`), because that is the door where the
/// measured probe was admitted and the one moment the shape is cheap to
/// fix. Neither is said at the two UNATTENDED doors — the arrival rule
/// and `--unattended` — because nothing there reads a warning, and a
/// check nobody reads is a check that is not running (CLAUDE.md
/// §Diagnosis). What those two got instead is a VERDICT that names one
/// thing: [`failure_diagnosis`], and the `why` on the attempt record.

// THE UNATTENDED DOOR — `boss prove <car> --from-car --unattended`
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// What the forge's ops-runner runs for a `run-car-probe` ops-request
// (infra/ops/verbs/run-car-probe.json), filed by the dispatcher rule
// run-car-probes-on-train-arrived for every car aboard an arrived
// train that recorded a probe at park time, and again by
// recheck-failing-probes-hourly for a car whose last run settled
// nothing. Until backlog 9f00a805 (consolidation H8, car 2) the verb
// ran infra/forge/run-car-probe.sh — 482 lines of shell re-implementing
// this file's judge, verdict and records, because the forge had no
// `boss` binary; car 1 installs the tree's CLI there from the converged
// image (infra/estate/install-cli-from-image.sh), so the twin is
// retired and the ops-request runs this door instead. Measured before
// choosing it: of the four candidate twins this was the only one with
// a CLI verb to retire INTO (tenant-census.sh, retire-example-
// reference-rows.sh and prune-registry-versions.sh have none), and the
// gaps it had were these, each closed here:
//
//   - the probe runs as ANOTHER USER (root drops to $BOSS_PROBE_USER,
//     default david) in the converged checkout ($BOSS_PROBE_DIR,
//     default /home/david/boss) under a timeout ($BOSS_PROBE_TIMEOUT,
//     default 60 s) — `Shell::unattended`;
//   - the probe's environment is exactly what a recorded probe is
//     promised: BOSS_JOBS_URL, a READ-ONLY reader identity as
//     BOSS_SOR_USER (backlog 61085a9e — never this verb's own write
//     actor, which is stripped), the reader's port table as
//     BOSS_SOR_PORTS (design 28d2bed9, read as data from the checkout's
//     infra/forge/sor-ports.env), infra/forge/probe-bin first on
//     PATH so `boss-sor-read` is the cheap thing to type, and the
//     car's OWN converged instant (backlog a92571a6 — the fixed cutoff
//     a dated claim compares against, since the checkout's HEAD moves
//     with every train);
//   - every outcome lands on the car: PROVEN completes `proven` with
//     the proof record (and `proven_by`, which the yard reads); every
//     other verdict — NOT YET, NOT RUN, NOT PROVEN — stamps
//     `proof_attempt` and leaves `proven` ready, where the hand door
//     prints NOT PROVEN to the operator and records nothing;
//   - the exit code IS the verdict the ops-request carries: 0 proven,
//     1 not proven, 3 did not run, 75 not yet, 2 refused;
//   - a refusal changes nothing and names why (exit 2); a car already
//     proven is "nothing to run", exit 0, because the daily recheck
//     re-files for a car whose attempt has since been settled by hand.
