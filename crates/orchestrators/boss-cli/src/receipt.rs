//! `boss receipt <car>` — what does this car's receipt actually vouch for?
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A VERB. The third of the three Class A questions in
//! backlog-item 26b3d203. A gate receipt is the only evidence a car
//! carries, and it vouches for something narrower than people read it
//! as. Two gaps, both of which have cost real work:
//!
//!   THE HEAD MOVED. A receipt names the sha it gated. Rebase or
//!   force-push the branch afterwards and the receipt still reads
//!   "green" while describing a tree that is no longer there. Three
//!   cars' stale receipts were "repaired" on 2026-08-27, the API
//!   answered 204 three times, nothing was written, and the cars were
//!   reported fixed while staying unboardable (09576fab).
//!
//!   THE MODE IS NOT THE SAME GATE. `--auto` derives its scope from the
//!   tree and skips cargo entirely when nothing implies a crate. That
//!   is correct and it is NOT a full gate: a green receipt in auto mode
//!   vouches for the lints, not the suites. "A green gate only covers
//!   what it runs" is a whole separate finding, and reading a mode-auto
//!   receipt as a full one is how a ci.yml change gated green and broke
//!   CI on the train.
//!
//! So the verb answers three things a reader needs and a shell pipeline
//! keeps re-deriving: what sha the receipt covers, whether the branch
//! still points there, and how much of the gate actually ran.
