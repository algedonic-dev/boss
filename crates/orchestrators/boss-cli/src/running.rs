//! `boss running` — merged, deployed and running are three facts.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A VERB. The second of the three questions backlog-item
//! 26b3d203 names as hand-rolled every session: "which release is
//! deployed and does it carry this change?" On 2026-08-29 alone it was
//! written fresh at least six times, and it went wrong in both
//! directions:
//!
//!   - A migration was present in the deployed commit while the live
//!     registry still answered the OLD value, because the train had
//!     DEPLOYED but not CONVERGED and convergence is what runs
//!     migrate.sh. A source-level check would have recorded a true
//!     statement about the tree beside a false one about production.
//!   - A StepType was merged AND deployed while the API still reported
//!     45 kinds, because the registry is built from a TOML embedded in
//!     the binary at startup and the pods had not rolled.
//!   - A CI image was nearly reported stale off the wrong docker
//!     daemon — the user-level one rather than the rootful one the
//!     runner actually uses.
//!
//! THE DISTINCTION IS THE POINT. Three different facts get called
//! "deployed" in conversation:
//!
//!   MERGED    the forge's main carries it            (`boss merged`)
//!   DEPLOYED  a release directory exists and `current` points at it
//!   RUNNING   the process serving requests was built from it
//!
//! They are routinely different, and the gap between the last two is
//! where a proof records something true about a tree and false about
//! production. This verb reports all three side by side so the gap is
//! visible rather than assumed.
