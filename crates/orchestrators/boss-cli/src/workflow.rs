//! `boss workflow publish <kind> <spec.json | bundle.toml | bundle-dir>`
//! — publish a protocol version without the footgun. A `.toml` path is
//! a workflow bundle (a tenant's, or one platform kind file
//! `infra/platform/workflows/<kind>.toml`) and a directory is the
//! platform bundle itself (`infra/platform/workflows`): the `kind` row
//! is read with the platform seed's own loader, so the row a fresh
//! database seeds and the row a live one publishes are one definition.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A VERB. Publishing was a hand-assembled sequence, done
//! three times in one day for ship-a-change v20/v21/v22 and again for
//! v23: GET the active spec, mutate it, re-inject the fields a
//! publishable row needs, `_validate`, create the draft, publish, then
//! GET again to see what actually went live (f2c2ed14).
//!
//! IT CAUSED A LIVE REGRESSION, and the mechanism is worth stating
//! exactly. `POST /api/workflows/{kind}/publish` takes NO BODY — it
//! promotes whatever draft currently exists, and a `{"version": 20}`
//! body is ignored rather than honoured. On 2026-08-28 the draft-create
//! failed 422 for a missing field, so nothing was created, and the
//! follow-up publish promoted a STALE v16 draft left over from earlier
//! work. ship-a-change ran as v16 in production for about four minutes.
//! v16 has no `proven` step at all, so any car admitted in that window
//! would have shipped with no proof step. Zero were — luck, not design.
//!
//! So the load-bearing move here is not convenience. It is REFUSING TO
//! PUBLISH INTO A DIRTY REGISTRY: if a draft already exists that is not
//! the one this command just created, stop and say what is sitting
//! there, because that is precisely the state that promoted v16.
//!
//! The other half is that every step is CHECKED rather than assumed —
//! the draft is read back before it is promoted, and the active row is
//! read back after. A publish that reports success without confirming
//! what went live is how a regression stays invisible for four minutes.
