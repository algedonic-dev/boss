//! A parked car whose files main moved under is re-gated on current main
//! before it may board (backlog 969a1092).
//!
//! WHY THE DOCK AND NOT THE TRAIN. A gate judges a branch's tree in
//! isolation, so its green vouches for the car on the main it was cut
//! from. When main moves before the car boards, the first thing that ever
//! tests the car against what landed in between is the TRAIN gate — and
//! it runs only after a consist is assembled, PR'd and CI'd, so a clash
//! it finds costs a whole train. Measured 2026-09-24: IT map car G
//! (`feat/it-phone-strip-map`) was gated on bb6f4f18; car F
//! (`feat/it-map-hud-frame-one-row-per-third`) landed as a9028721 and
//! changed `apps/web/src/it/yard/regions.ts`, the Regions type G's test
//! builds; train 17:17 (f7bd1e9d) went red on the web typecheck. G was
//! rebuilt on a9028721 as `-2`; car E landed as d013ec41 and changed the
//! same type again; train 18:31 (02801b05) went red the same way. Both
//! were cancelled by hand, and each held the track while it was red.
//!
//! THE RULE, computed from git alone — the car's changed files, and the
//! files main changed since the car's gated base:
//!
//!   - the SAME PATH on both sides always touches;
//!   - Rust widens to the CRATE (`crates/<tier>/<name>/`): a crate is one
//!     compile unit, so a change anywhere in it can break the car's build;
//!   - TypeScript/Svelte widens to the file's DIRECTORY, the unit the web
//!     app co-locates a component, its types and its test in (CLAUDE.md
//!     §TypeScript): G's `phone-strip.test.ts` imports `regions.ts` from
//!     beside it, and that is the edge that broke;
//!   - but a LEAF main changed — a `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*` file, or a Rust
//!     integration test directly under a crate's `tests/` — touches only
//!     its own path. Nothing imports a test file, and without this cut
//!     the rule re-gated 81 of the 138 cars that landed on 2026-09-24
//!     rather than 47: most of the difference was one shared mocked-spec
//!     directory and `boss-testing`'s shell-test binaries, each touched by
//!     nearly every train.
//!
//! What it does NOT see, said so a reader does not assume it: a change to
//! a crate the car's crate DEPENDS on, a web module imported from another
//! directory, and a test main ADDED against code the car changes. The
//! train gate still judges every assembled tree; this rule only moves the
//! commonest clash out of it and onto a single car.
//!
//! THE BOUND. At most one re-gate per car per main move: the launch is
//! stamped on the car (`base_regate.main`) and a car already re-gated for
//! the main it would board on is never re-gated for it again. A car whose
//! files main did not touch boards exactly as before, however far behind.
//!
//! THE REPAIR IS THE ONE THAT ALREADY EXISTS. The car's branch is replayed
//! onto current main by `freshness::rebase_onto_main` (the `boss gate
//! --rebase` door), and a gate-run is filed for the new head carrying a
//! park intent. Its green reaches the auto-park handler, which finds the
//! car still at the dock and refreshes it in place — `ParkAction::Refresh`
//! in `jobs_auto_park.rs`, the path CLAUDE.md §Doors names as the repair
//! for a moved branch. Nothing here copies a receipt.
//!
//! AND IT MUST NEVER FREEZE A LANDING (the ordering edge's rule, in
//! `boarding.rs`). An unreadable base, an unreachable cluster, a push the
//! forge refused — every way the MEANS fail boards the car as gated,
//! loudly, because the train gate still stands behind it. Only an answer
//! about the CAR holds it: main moved into its files, a gate slot is busy
//! this window, or its replay onto main conflicts.
