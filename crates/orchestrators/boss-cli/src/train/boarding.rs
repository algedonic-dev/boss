//! Why a board departs nothing — the no-departure line and the declared ordering edge.

use super::*;

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A BOARD THAT DEPARTS NO TRAIN OPENS NO PACKET
//
// Ten hours of delivery went to this on 2026-09-10 (backlog 4860aff8).
// ONE car sat on the dock that the consist check refused. The board
// cadence is queue-depth based and re-fires every 60 seconds while the
// dock stays deep, and every attempt OPENED a pr-train Job and then
// cancelled it: `pr-train` total passed 982, the newest 100 rows all
// closed inside 99 minutes, 89 `outcome: cancelled`, and 100 of 100
// with no `boarded_jobs`. That is ~1,440 phantom packets a day from one
// unboardable car. It turned the branch sweep's 50-row window over in
// under an hour (02069932) and it lied to every window read — the yard,
// `boss orient`, and any count of how many trains ran.
//
// The refusal itself was already right: no PR opened, no CI spent. What
// it did not skip was the PACKET, because the Job was created BEFORE
// the check ran — for one reason, that the refusal wanted somewhere to
// record itself. The record is cheaper than that:
//
//   - each car keeps its own `skip_reason`, and for a consist refusal
//     the structured `consist_refusal` too — the lint output, on the
//     car whose boarding it blocked, where the operator already looks;
//   - the journal gets ONE line, this one, which names the reason and
//     says outright that no packet was opened, so nobody goes hunting
//     the yard for a train that never existed.
//
// A packet is a fact that something happened; a train that never
// departed is not one. And until it was cancelled it also HELD THE
// TRACK, so a cancel lost to one API blip wedged boarding behind a
// train that had never left the yard.

// THE DECLARED ORDERING EDGE — a car names the car it boards AFTER
//
// Four cars were held by hand on 2026-09-10 and every one of them was an
// ordering constraint (backlog d3320278; design doc 364f892e, all three
// questions accepted as proposed). `fix/the-reclaim-follows-the-build`
// was gated `--hold` and parked by hand when the dock happened to be
// empty, purely so it would board SOLO as a gate-blind ci.yml change;
// `feat/a-deleted-manifest-leaves-no-object` spent a day waiting for a
// human to notice both halves of a two-part sequence were satisfied. The
// operator WAS the mechanism, and the mechanism was re-reading the dock.
//
// FILTER, DO NOT PLAN (decision 3). Boarding skips a car whose declared
// predecessor has not landed; it does not compute a multi-train
// sequence. A plan buys nothing the filter does not, because the next
// board happens on its own inside the cooldown. If the dock ever grows
// deep enough that planning is visibly better, that is a second car.
//
// AN UNSATISFIABLE EDGE REFUSES AND IS NAMED (decision 2). Boarding
// anyway after a timeout was rejected: it reintroduces exactly the
// collision the edge prevents. So the refusal is LOUD on every 60-second
// board attempt, and it is FOUR refusals rather than one, because an
// operator reading the dock is deciding whether the pipeline is stuck:
//
//   still in flight  — nobody does anything; it departs on its own
//   landed           — satisfied; the car boards (no refusal at all)
//   abandoned        — a human must break the edge; it will never clear
//   no such Job      — a human must fix the reference
//
// Collapsing those into "dependency not met" would build the quiet hold
// this feature exists to remove (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: quiet is a loan
// against the next diagnosis).
//
// AND IT MUST NEVER FREEZE A LANDING. A fallible read inside the board
// loop that refused everything it could not evaluate would stop every
// train, and the gate does not run the conductor, so the gate would not
// catch it. Every way the read can fail therefore DEGRADES TOWARD
// BOARDING, loudly: `Unreadable` is a journal line and the car rides.
// The edge's job is to stop a known collision, not to become a new way
// for the pipeline to stop.
