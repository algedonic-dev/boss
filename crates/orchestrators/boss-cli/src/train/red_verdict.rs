//! A red verdict names its LOG — the failing-check excerpt and the red-train alert.

use super::*;

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A red verdict names its LOG, not just its check (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis,
// "a verdict must name what failed"). Naming `test` is half the answer;
// the operator still had to go re-derive WHY. These pure helpers turn a
// failing check into the id of the job that failed and a bounded tail of
// its log, resolving the id through the ONE endpoint that answers
// correctly. The forge seam does the fetching; everything decidable
// about a JSON payload is decided here, where it can be pinned.
//
// THE TRAP these encode around (live-confirmed 2026-09-06): the job log
// lives at `/actions/jobs/{JOB_ID}/logs`, but the JOB_ID must come from
// `/actions/runs/{run}/jobs` — NOT from `/actions/tasks`. A commit
// status's `target_url` is `…/actions/runs/{run}/jobs/{index}`, so it
// carries the run AND the job's position in that run: index into the
// run's jobs array and read its `id`. Reading the entry's `task_id`
// instead (the tasks-list id) silently returns a DIFFERENT job's log —
// run 462's failing `web` was job id 2008 / task_id 1939, and
// `jobs/1939/logs` was an unrelated SUCCESS. Position is unambiguous;
// name is only a cross-check.

/// How many bytes of a job log to pull (a suffix Range request — the
/// forge answers `206 Partial Content`, so a 300KB+ log never crosses
/// the wire whole) and how much of that to keep once fetched.
/// How much of a failing job's log to pull back from the forge.
///
/// This was 16 KB for as long as the alert only ever showed a TAIL. On
/// 2026-09-09 train 864a4896 reddened on a Rust test that panicked at
/// byte ~460 K of a 778 KB log; the last 16 KB held svelte-check
/// deprecation warnings from five minutes later, so the alert named the
/// check and then showed the reader something irrelevant to it, and the
/// real cause took a hand dig through the forge Actions API to find
/// (packet 792d26be). A suffix Range large enough to contain the whole
