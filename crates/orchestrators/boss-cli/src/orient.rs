//! `boss orient` — a session's first verb: the approach, in one read.
//!
//! THE CASE (acedf981, and CLAUDE.md §Engineering Session Startup). A
//! new session starts blind, and the queue does not un-blind it: on
//! 2026-09-01 the durable pod session rebuilt a landed fix from a stale
//! base, closed five already-fixed "open" packets one by one, and
//! duplicated a branch that sat green-gated and unparked — every one of
//! those visible at startup, spread across five separate queries nobody
//! ran. This verb is those queries, assembled: trains in transit, gates
//! running, greens that never became cars (the stranded — reusing the
//! census cross-ref, not a second definition), the dock, and the task
//! queue, with the startup checklist's load-bearing lines at the end.
//!
//! Read-only. Inherits `gate::api`'s no-default `BOSS_JOBS_URL` rule —
//! fitting, since orienting against the wrong instance is the exact
//! defect class the rule exists for (aa783636).
