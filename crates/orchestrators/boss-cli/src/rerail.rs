//! `boss rerail <car>` — a conflict-skipped car back aboard, with the
//! traps encoded.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A VERB (e7c86455). When boarding skips a car on a merge
//! conflict, the by-hand recovery is ten steps: fetch, worktree,
//! rebase, resolve, gate the new head, transcribe the receipt, repoint
//! the packet, re-board. Done for 7 cars on 2026-08-15, one on 08-23,
//! one on 08-30 — each time re-walking three traps that have each cost
//! real time:
//!
//!   - THE BRANCH MUST BE NEW. A force-push to the old branch is
//!     classifier-blocked (and rightly: it yanks a ref others hold),
//!     so the rebased tree goes to `<branch>-rerail` — the 08-15
//!     precedent, now the verb's contract.
//!   - THE GATE STEP IS FROZEN. A car's gate receipt vouches for ONE
//!     head; superseding it means writing `metadata.regate_receipt`
//!     on the JOB, never editing the completed step (the boarding
//!     logic and `boss receipt` both prefer regate_receipt).
//!   - THE RECEIPT IS MACHINE-COPIED. Never retyped, never
//!     hand-authored (never-write-a-sha-you-did-not-read): it is read
//!     back from the gate-run packet by `park::receipt_for`, byte for
//!     byte.
//!
//! The verb stops for a human at exactly one place — a real conflict
//! hunk — and hands back the worktree with the remaining sequence
//! printed, finishable with `--finish` once the branch is pushed.
//!
//! `--finish` RUNS AS OFTEN AS THE HEAD MOVES (02165b1d). It used to
//! derive `<car branch>-rerail` unconditionally, which meant it worked
//! exactly once per car: run again on an already-re-railed branch it
//! hunted for `…-rerail-rerail` and refused, leaving no designed way to
//! put a fresh receipt on a car whose head had moved — and the
//! improvised way (re-gate with `--park-*`) filed a twin car. It now
//! asks the forge: a rerail in flight is finished onto its branch, and
//! with no such branch `--finish` REFRESHES the car where it stands.
//! Either way the receipt comes from `park::receipt_for`, so it refuses
//! unless a green vouches for the branch's head right now.
