//! `boss merged <branch>` — did this change actually land on main?
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A VERB. Backlog-item 26b3d203 classified fourteen errors
//! from one session: seven were an ad-hoc shell check producing a
//! confident WRONG answer, and this exact question accounts for three of
//! them. Every occurrence was a fresh pipeline written to answer it,
//! and each failed differently:
//!
//!   - `git merge-base --is-ancestor gcp/<branch> <main>` reported NOT
//!     MERGED for all 89 cars, because an arrived train DELETES its
//!     cars' branches and a missing ref makes merge-base error. A
//!     branch being gone is the SIGNATURE of success here, and the
//!     check read it as failure.
//!   - Testing the car's receipt sha reported NOT MERGED for all 89,
//!     because trains SQUASH-merge, so a car's commit is never an
//!     ancestor of main no matter how thoroughly it landed.
//!   - Content-checking against `gcp/realmain` reported the change
//!     absent, because that ref is a stale local alias and not what
//!     trains merge into.
//!
//! All three answered "no" for reasons unrelated to the question. That
//! is the failure this module exists to make unrepeatable: the rules
//! live in one pure function with a test per documented failure, rather
//! than being re-derived in a shell each time someone asks.
//!
//! THE AUTHORITY IS THE FORGE, read live. A local ref can be stale, and
//! `origin` on a workstation is the GitHub mirror rather than the forge
//! ([[boss-where-to-push-a-car]]). So main is resolved by `ls-remote`
//! against the remote that actually receives trains.
