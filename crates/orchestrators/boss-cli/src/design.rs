//! `boss design` — file a design-doc packet in the shape the protocol
//! can actually process.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. David, 2026-09-02: *"Design doc failures are pretty
//! common. Makes me think we don't provide good instructions on
//! triggering a job of that protocol."* The cause runs deeper than
//! instructions: the `design-doc` workflow's `metadata_schema` is `{}`,
//! its review step declares `title`/`markdown`/`doc_path` and NOT
//! `questions` — the one field the whole protocol exists to process —
//! and a Job's metadata is never validated against a schema anywhere.
//! So a malformed draft is admitted silently and the cost lands on the
//! reviewer, who opens a design doc with nothing to answer.
//!
//! I proved it the same hour by falling in it: a packet filed with its
//! questions written as prose inside `metadata.detail` reached David's
//! queue showing zero questions. With full repo access and the
//! convention in front of me, I still got the shape wrong.
//!
//! This is the door (the `2e136a67` fix, part two). It writes the shape
//! read off a doc that renders correctly: job metadata carrying
//! `title` / `markdown` / `questions`, mirrored onto the
//! `review-design` step alongside `doc_path` and an empty
//! `resolutions`. Nobody has to know that, which is the point.
//!
//! AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT UNTIL 2026-09-04. The body it built set the
//! doc title in `metadata.title` only, and the filer requires the
//! ENVELOPE's `title` at admission — so every invocation of this verb
//! returned `422 invalid job body: missing title`, and design docs kept
//! going in as hand-built JSON POSTed straight at `/api/jobs`, which is
//! the exact failure mode the verb exists to retire. Nothing in the
//! tree exercised the call, so the omission shipped and survived; the
//! test that now closes it deserializes the body into the same
//! `boss_core::job::Job` the handler does, which asks the authoritative
//! type what it demands instead of listing the fields someone
//! remembered. `gate.rs` learned this the same way, for `tags`.
//!
//! `--no-questions` is the flag David asked for: a doc that records a
//! decision already made belongs in the system of record without
//! queuing a review. It writes `no_open_questions = "true"`, which the
//! v4 protocol's predicates route around.
//!
//! THE FLAG IS ALWAYS WRITTEN, never omitted. `boss-expr` errors on an
//! absent identifier rather than resolving it false, and the codebase's
//! own answer to that is to always write the key — `jobs.clear_waiting`
//! clears `waiting_on` to `""` rather than deleting it, "so the edge
//! guard resolves the empty string trivially". A packet that simply
//! left the flag out would stall its own review step.
