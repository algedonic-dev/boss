//! The platform owner, for every packet a verb files — a car, a
//! gate-run, a design doc, the conductor's alarms (backlog 3c23662d,
//! design 42277636). The port and the WHY are
//! `boss_core::platform_owner`; this module is only how a verb that
//! knows the jobs base reaches the people registry, and the one line it
//! prints when the registry refuses.
//!
//! WHERE THE PEOPLE API IS. A verb has `BOSS_JOBS_URL` and nothing
//! else. The system of record is several services on one address
//! (design 28d2bed9, boss-jobs-internal.yaml), each on the port
//! boss-ports assigns it, so the people door is the jobs base with its
//! port moved to `boss_ports::prod("people")` — the rule the shell doors
//! apply in infra/forge/probe-bin/sor-routes.sh (`sor_base_on_port`).
//! `BOSS_PEOPLE_URL` names it outright when set (a launcher, a test).
//! The host is never this module's to choose: a verb that named its own
//! host could read a different stack and get a well-formed answer about
//! different data (CLAUDE.md §Doors).
