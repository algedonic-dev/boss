//! Is a branch's base current with `origin/main`? ONE definition, shared.
//!
//! Two verbs need the same answer and must not disagree about it
//! (CLAUDE.md §9a): `boss orient`'s FRESHNESS section, which names
//! parked/stranded cars whose base has fallen behind, and `boss gate`,
//! which refuses to spend a gate on a base that is not current. Before
//! this module the first existed and the second did not, and the gap is
//! exactly the window the measured defect lives in: a car that is
//! GATING and RE-GATING is neither parked nor stranded, so nothing
//! looked at its base at all (2026-09-11, backlog 31a28f49).
//!
//! ## What the hazard actually is
//!
//! Not a revert. `train.rs::rerail_onto_consist` rebases every car from
//! its merge-base onto the consist, so the deletions a stale branch's
//! `diff origin/main` shows can never board — that was measured on
//! 2026-08-29, and it is why a deletion count is a SCREEN and not a
//! verdict: one parked car showed 590 deletions against main and was
//! completely safe to merge, and acting on the count alone would have
//! force-pushed a healthy parked car into being unboardable.
//!
//! The hazard is **the receipt**. A gate judges the branch's tree in
//! isolation. If that tree is not the tree that will land, a green
//! vouches for a tree that will never exist — and the car parks with
//! evidence that means nothing. Train #244 went red that way on
//! 2026-09-07 with two innocent cars aboard: a car gated on a base taken
//! before another car landed, whose new test broke against a contract
//! the other car had tightened **in a different file**. Which settles the
//! shape of the test — see [`BaseObservation::untested`].
//!
//! ## Why `origin/main` and not `infra/lint/lib/trunk-ref.sh`
//!
//! That library walks `forge/main` → `origin/main` → `main` because a
//! LINT runs wherever the tree is checked out, and on a dev box `origin`
//! can be the GitHub mirror — a periodic backup that was 24 commits stale
//! the day it was written. `boss gate` is not in that position: it pushes
//! to, resolves against and fetches from `origin` in every other line of
//! its launch path (`resolve_sha`, `observe_landing`), and `boss orient`
//! reads `origin/main` too. Taking a different ref here would mean the
//! branch was gated against one trunk and judged fresh against another.
//! If `origin` ever stops being the forge for this verb, it changes in
//! one place for the whole verb, not for this module alone.
