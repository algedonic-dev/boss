//! Where the IT department's work comes from — the INPUT-channel mix.
//!
//! Design: "IT delivery channels", approved 2026-09-06 as a design-doc
//! packet; its file under docs/design/ was folded and deleted with the
//! 2026-09-10 docs cleanup (f5da586c), so the packet is the record.
//! A job has two orthogonal channels: `input_channel` (the lane it
//! entered through) and `delivery_channel` (how it ships). This module
//! answers the first, and reports the *mix* — the algedonic reading
//! David watches: work driven by USER FEEDBACK is proactive (building
//! what is wanted), work driven by MONITORING and ERROR DISCOVERY is
//! reactive (firefighting). A department whose input tilts toward
//! firefighting is in pain; the distribution over time is the signal.
//!
//! Read-only. Classification is a pure function of the job, heuristic
//! today and refined as each lane earns its own admission protocol
//! (only user-feedback is a real lane so far); an ambiguous job is
//! named `unclassified` rather than guessed into false precision.
