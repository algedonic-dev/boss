//! `boss gate <branch>` — launching a gate is one verb, not seven steps.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS (filed 51ca3405). Launching a gate by hand was:
//! write the gate-run packet JSON, POST it, `sed` three placeholders
//! into the runner manifest, split the Job document out of the
//! multi-doc YAML because it uses `generateName` and cannot be
//! `apply`-ed, delete the previous Job, create the new one, then
//! hand-roll a watcher. None of that is judgement; it is the same
//! sequence every time, and on 2026-08-26 it was performed nine times
//! in one afternoon.
//!
//! The tell that it should be a verb is not that it is tedious. It is
//! that doing it CORRECTLY by hand still produces orphans: two open
//! gate-run packets (1fcad667, 2267121b) exist against the same branch
//! because a run died and the single-use packet discipline meant filing
//! a fresh one. Only something that owns the packet's lifecycle can
//! avoid that, which is why this reuses an open packet for the same
//! branch and sha instead of filing a duplicate.
//!
//! ON CONCURRENCY. Gates run in PARALLEL since packet 28de3845: the
//! runner's workspace is a per-run emptyDir (seeded warm from the old
//! PVC, which survives as the seed + crate cache), so two gates cannot
//! see each other's tree and the 2026-08-24 crossed-receipts incident
//! is structurally impossible — proven shape: on 2026-08-26 six
//! emptyDir gates ran side by side and produced six correct
//! independent receipts. The old one-gate-per-shared-workspace refusal
//! (and the volumeattachment detach guard that served it) died in the
//! same car that made dying safe; the isolation contract is pinned by
//! boss-testing's gate_runner_parallel_workspace tests rather than
//! re-derived from the rendered manifest here.
//!
//! What remains bounded is the NODE, not correctness. Five parallel
//! gates put w-1 at 65% I/O pressure with CPU pressure at 0.00 and
//! stretched a 35-minute gate to 93 minutes — so this verb counts live
//! gate Jobs and holds at [`DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT`] (override:
//! BOSS_GATE_MAX_CONCURRENT). The count is best-effort against a race
//! (two verbs counting at once can both see N-1), which is acceptable
//! now that over-admission costs minutes, not verdicts; the scheduler's
//! ephemeral-storage accounting is the hard backstop on the disk.
//!
//! ON THE BOUND: IT QUEUES, AND A REFUSAL FILES NOTHING (fd217c65).
//! Measured 2026-09-08: 24 green gates, 6 red — and 21 launches refused
//! at the bound. Each refusal had ALREADY filed its gate-run packet, so
//! it closed the packet with the only terminal the protocol offers a run
//! that produced no verdict: `lost`, whose label is "Gate lost
//! (environment died)". Nothing died; the node was busy. Twenty-one
//! phantom runs polluted the day's history and the yard's counts, and
//! five builders each hand-rolled a five-minute retry loop — two
//! collided on a shared script, and one outlived the session that made
//! it and re-gated an already-green branch into a twin car.
//!
//! Both halves are fixed here, and they are the same fix seen twice: a
//! station holds, it does not drop. [`admission`] decides Launch / Queue
//! / Refuse from observations taken BEFORE any packet exists, so a
//! refusal files nothing; and at the bound a `--wait` caller takes a
//! place in line ([`QUEUED_AT`]) that this process holds by heartbeat
//! until a slot frees, oldest first. The launcher is this verb, not the
//! conductor and not a dispatcher rule: creating a gate Job needs the
//! Kubernetes credential and the runner manifest, and the conductor
//! holds neither by design (`infra/cluster/manifests/boss-conductor.yaml`
//! — "RBAC: NONE"). "A slot is free" is also a CLUSTER fact that no BOSS
//! event announces — a gate Job can die without reporting — so an
//! event-driven launcher would stall the line permanently on exactly the
//! failure the queue exists to survive, where a poll re-derives it every
//! time. And a place held by a live process cannot outlive its
//! session, which is the second defect above, structurally.
//!
//! AND THE PRICE OF THAT CHOICE: A QUEUED RUN IS ONLY AS ALIVE AS ITS
//! WAITER (76d41004). The place expiring is the design working; the
//! PACKET outliving it is not. Measured 2026-09-10 22:41–22:51Z: a
//! `--wait` process was killed for memory while its run was queued, and
//! the open gate-run sat with no Job, no holder, and nothing that would
//! ever launch it — for ten minutes, and indefinitely if nobody looked,
//! rendered the whole time as a run patiently waiting its turn. That is
//! exactly what the `!wait` refusal above exists to prevent, reached by
//! any interruption of the client. Contrast 464309ee: a waiter killed
//! AFTER the launch costs nothing, because the `--park-*` intent is on
//! the packet where the dispatcher can read it. Intent recorded outside
//! the process survives; intent that IS the process does not.
//!
//! [`abandoned_places`] makes the strand a named, purely SoR-computable
//! fact (`boss orient` reports it), which turns an indefinite silence
//! into a line within [`QUEUE_PLACE_TTL_SECS`]. What it deliberately
//! does NOT do is relaunch. A resident launcher needs three things this
//! car cannot put in place: a Kubernetes credential for whatever process
//! holds it (the two arguments above still stand — and an unsupervised
//! launcher makes them sharper, not softer); a re-validation of the
//! branch at launch time, since an adopted place may have landed or
//! grown a green twin since it was taken; and, above all, an ATOMIC
//! claim on the packet. Today's exclusion is a cluster read
//! (`live_gate_for_packet`) plus clear-then-create, which is adequate
//! for one process launching its own place and NOT adequate for two
//! unsynchronised launchers — two Jobs for one packet is a worse failure
//! than the strand, because it crosses receipts. The existing primitive
//! with the right shape is the cadence loop's firing claim (a firing id
//! that is a pure function of its inputs, deduped by a primary key), so
//! a launcher should claim `(packet, window)` there rather than invent a
//! lock. Adoption by another WAITER is not the fix either: in the
//! measured incident the dead waiter was the only one in line.

///     rather than a promise: on 2026-09-08 a builder's session ended
