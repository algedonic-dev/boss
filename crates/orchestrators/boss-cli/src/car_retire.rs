//! `boss car retire <car> --carried-by <landed car | merge sha>` and
//! `boss car retire <car> --superseded-by <car>` — close a car whose
//! work another car carries, on the evidence, through its terminal
//! (backlog 87f1c86a).
//!
//! WHY. On 2026-09-24 four parked cars were twins: car D's commit rode
//! inside car E, the two device-shop cars inside the refurb car — all
//! landed in train #634 — and an old car G was replaced by its rebuild.
//! They were held by hand so the conductor would stop leaving them
//! behind every train, and then nothing could close them: `boss car`
//! had `open` and `waits-on`, `boss merged` answered UNKNOWN, `boss
//! rerail` refuses a vanished branch. The dock read HELD 4 and the
//! garage stayed amber for as long as nobody closed them by hand.
//!
//! WHAT COUNTS AS CARRIED — MEASURED ON THOSE CARS, NOT ASSUMED. The
//! obvious proof is patch-id: a cherry-pick has a new sha and the same
//! patch-id. It proved ONE of the four twin commits. The other three
//! were replayed with a conflict resolved — car D's `MapPage.svelte`
//! against car E's, the device-shop engine's
//! `tenant-vocabulary.baseline` counts against the refurb car's — so
//! their patches differ in exactly one file each, and a patch-id-only
//! verb would have refused every car it was built for. What a replay
//! keeps is the AUTHORED commit: author, author time to the second, and
//! subject all survive `cherry-pick` and `rebase`. So a commit is
//! carried when the carrier holds its patch-id (identical), or holds
//! the same authored commit (a replay) — and a replay is accepted only
//! when the operator says `--accept-replay`, after the verb has named
//! each file whose patch differs. The machine can prove identity; that
//! a resolution kept the work is a judgement, and it goes on the record
//! as one. A commit matching neither is refused by name.
//!
//! THE CARRIER MUST HAVE LANDED, OBSERVED. A branch resolves to its
//! landed car; a merge sha to the landed cars that record it as their
//! `merge_ref`. Either way the merge is checked to be an ancestor of
//! the forge's main, and the carrier's commits are read from the head
//! it BOARDED — the exact tree the train carried.
//!
//! SUPERSEDED is a different fact and a different terminal: the car's
//! own work never landed, another car replaced it. That is `abandoned`,
//! with the successor named — and the successor must exist, be live or
//! landed, and name the same item.
//!
//! The writes themselves are `boss_jobs::car_retire::retire_writes`,
//! pinned against the real router in
//! `crates/core/boss-jobs/tests/ship_a_change_landed_twin.rs`.
