//! `boss car open <branch>` — the car exists from the first minute of
//! the build, not from the moment it succeeds.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS (backlog be025b44). Auto-park filed the
//! `ship-a-change` packet when the gate went GREEN, which is the END of
//! the build. Everything before that left no trace: an agent working for
//! forty minutes, a builder blocked, two agents on the same file. The
//! system of record learned about the work only once it had succeeded.
//!
//! MEASURED, TWICE. On 2026-09-08 three builder sessions died mid-flight
//! and nothing anywhere said so — the only symptom was a twin car
//! appearing on the dock later, filed by a retry loop that outlived its
//! agent. On 2026-09-09 four builders ran for 19, 26, 31 and 47 minutes
//! and the yard showed an empty dock throughout.
//!
//! SO THE BUILDER OPENS THE CAR. This verb files the packet at `opened`,
//! declares the `scope` it was given, CLAIMS the `build` step, and
//! records who is building, on which host, in which worktree, since
//! when. A green then FINISHES that packet — `boss park` and the
//! auto-park handler both adopt a car that is already building rather
//! than filing a second — so a branch has exactly ONE packet from its
//! first minute, which closes the twinning failure mode by construction:
//! there is no window in which "no car" is the right answer.
//!
//! AND IT STATES WHICH ITEM IT IS FOR (backlog 90d291bb). Exactly one of
//! `--backlog-item` (this car IS that item's build — the item closes when
//! the car lands), `--partial-item` (one piece of it — provenance only,
//! the item stays open) or `--no-item <REASON>`. The refusal when none is
//! given is `boss gate`'s own, shared rather than copied: see
//! [`ItemAnswer::check`].
//!
//! WHAT `--park-*` DOES NOW. It confirms. Saying the same thing again at
//! the gate is ACCEPTED SILENTLY — requiring a builder to repeat
//! themselves would be friction with no safety gain, and the adopt
//! rewrites the same value it finds. Saying something DIFFERENT still
//! goes through `supersede` in the auto-park handler rather than being
//! refused: a gate that refuses at green wastes the whole build, where
//! superseding costs one warn line, and the gate's answer is the later
//! one made with the finished diff. `supersede` therefore becomes dead
//! code in the common case — the right direction for a guard that exists
//! only because two verbs could state different things about one fact.
//!
//! NOT THE BOARD. This is the fact a board needs, and nothing more
//! (the item's own scope line: *"Not the board itself."*).

/// WHY HERE AND NOT ONLY AT THE GATE (backlog 90d291bb). `boss gate
/// --park-*` already demands one of three answers, but this verb took
/// only `--backlog-item`: the CLOSING edge. A builder opening a car for
/// ONE PIECE of a multi-piece item therefore had to either name the
/// closing edge — which is wrong, because the arrival rule follows that
/// key and would close an item with work outstanding — or say nothing,
/// losing the provenance for the whole build, which is exactly the
/// window the middle third exists to render.
///
/// THE DEEPER REASON IS THAT TWO VERBS COULD CONTRADICT EACH OTHER. An
/// open saying "close item X" and a gate saying "do not close X" were
/// both accepted, an hour apart, with nothing rejecting the pair; the
/// landed defence is `supersede` in the auto-park handler, which resolves
/// the disagreement in the safe direction. The builder who wrote it named
/// the better fix: *not being able to disagree is stronger than a guard
/// that resolves a disagreement.* So the answer is stated ONCE, here, at
