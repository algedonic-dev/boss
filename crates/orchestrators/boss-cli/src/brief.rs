//! `boss brief <packet>` — the handover a builder is dispatched with:
//! the packet verbatim from the system of record, and the invariants
//! derived from the files that decide them.
//!
//! THE CASE (backlog cc9ddc5d, measured on this pipeline 2026-09-11).
//! About ten builder briefs were written in one session. Every one
//! restated the same invariants from memory — the gate's check list, the
//! uid to verify under, fixture paths, the push-before-check order, the
//! base check, the forbidden database, and `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` — and
//! every one retyped them. That is CLAUDE.md §9a at its most expensive:
//! not a fact living twice but a fact living ten times, in prose nothing
//! can check.
//!
//! It had already cost. The uid invariant was WRONG IN ALL TEN: "verify
//! in a workspace owned by uid 65534" is not achievable on this pod,
//! because `CapEff` is 0xc0 — CAP_SETUID and CAP_SETGID, no CAP_CHOWN —
//! so `chown 65534` fails on /tmp, /scratch and /work alike. Three
//! builders resolved that three different ways in one day, because the
//! instruction named a requirement and not a method.
//!
//! And a second, separate damage: briefs SUMMARISED PACKETS from memory
//! instead of pointing at them. Two were materially wrong about the
//! packet's own defect class, and one was built around a code shape that
//! has zero instances on main.
//!
//! ## What this verb does about each
//!
//! Two halves, one for each measured failure.
//!
//! **The packet half** reads the packet live and prints every metadata
//! key VERBATIM AND UNTRUNCATED. This is the one thing it does that
//! `boss job get` deliberately does not: that verb FITS values to the
//! terminal, which is right for a list and wrong here, because a
//! truncated claim is exactly what sends a brief-writer back to memory
//! for the rest of the sentence. The contract is different, so the
//! renderer is separate — not a second copy of a shared one.
//!
//! **The invariant half** derives every statement from a file in the
//! tree and PRINTS THE FILE NEXT TO IT. Nothing here is a sentence
//! somebody typed about the gate: the uid and gid are read out of the
//! gate-runner manifest, the cargo bound out of the one env file that
//! holds it, the forbidden database out of `TestDb`'s own default, the
//! phase list out of `infra/gate.sh`'s `check` call sites, and the
//! pre-flight roster by ASKING `infra/gate.sh --roster` rather than
//! re-deriving what it already derives. A derivation cannot drift from
//! its authority; a paragraph can, and did, ten times.
//!
//! The method for the uid — the fact that was wrong every time — is not
//! described at all. It is a command: `infra/dev/as-gate-uid.sh`, which
//! has the target uid CREATE the workspace (the only route that works
//! without CAP_CHOWN) and prints what it did, so a receipt's `verified`
//! field can quote it instead of claiming it.
//!
//! **The rules half** (design c87fb59b car 2, backlog 39d0b528) prints
//! the profile's document from `infra/platform/documents/` after the
//! invariants — the same tree the invariants are derived from, read the
//! same way (`documents.rs`). Which profile is the step's own
//! `agent_profile`, projected from its Workflow row's `agent` block;
//! `builder` when it declares none. `boss dispatch` prints the same
//! rendering as its prompt, through the one `render`.
//!
//! Read-only, and it writes nothing. The packet read goes through
//! `gate::api`, so it inherits the no-default `BOSS_JOBS_URL` rule and
//! is signed as the caller.
