//! `boss tenant init <name> [--into <dir>]` / `boss tenant check <dir>`
//! — a tenant is a directory of its own (backlog fcc1d57b). `publish`
//! (tenant_publish.rs) lands one in an instance; `export`
//! (tenant_export.rs) writes the instance back into the same shape.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A VERB. Until 2026-09-16 a tenant had no home outside
//! the product tree: the only tenants were `examples/brewery` and
//! `examples/used-device-shop`, selected by `BOSS_TENANT_MANIFEST_TOML`
//! pointing INTO the product checkout. An adopter downloading BOSS had
//! nowhere natural to put their company except a patch to ours, and
//! Algedonic, LLC's own business could not live in `examples/` — the
//! public tier that mirrors to GitHub. Decided with David 2026-09-16:
//! a tenant is a directory OUTSIDE the product tree, in exactly the
//! shape of `examples/<tenant>/` (`tenant.toml` + `seeds/`); the
//! product's examples exercise the contract publicly; Algedonic's own
//! tenant is the private repo `david/algedonic-llc`, the first real
//! customer.
//!
//! THE CONTRACT IS MEASURED, NOT DESIGNED. [`CONTRACT`] is the list of
//! files the product actually READS from a tenant directory, found by
//! grepping every reader on 2026-09-16 (each entry's `read_by` names
//! it). One file the examples ship — `seeds/subject_kinds.toml` — has
//! NO reader today, and the table says so rather than implying one
//! (`seeds/locations.toml` was the other until its door landed on
//! 2026-09-17, backlog 1ec8312a). `docs/tenant-contract.md` carries
//! the same table between two markers; a test holds the two equal
//! (CLAUDE.md §9a), and `boss tenant contract` prints it for pasting.
//!
//! ONE LOADER, TWO DOORS. `check` validates each file with the type
//! or loader the product reads it with — `boss_jobs::seed_loader` for
//! workflows (with its viability lint), `boss_policy_client`'s grant
//! loader, the classes batch endpoint's `ClassInput`, the locations
//! batch endpoint's `LocationInput`, the ledger's `chart::AccountInput`
//! + `validate` for the chart of accounts (backlog 41af5195),
//! `boss_people`'s `Employee`, `boss_core`'s `BusinessCalendar` and
//! `TenantToml`, the dispatcher's own `[[rule]]` parser + publish-door
//! `validate` for `rules.toml` (backlog 458971ef). A second parser
//! would be a second contract that drifts. Where a file has no reader,
//! the parse is conservative and the table names that.
//!
//! WHAT A VERDICT CARRIES. Per file: OK / MISSING (required) / INVALID
//! (the loader's own error, never rephrased) / UNKNOWN (a file the
//! contract does not name — `seeds/agents.toml` in the real tenant was
//! the first such extension, until its seed landed on 2026-09-17,
//! backlog f56155f0). Exit 0 when nothing is MISSING or
//! INVALID. A file that parses to nothing because the loader reads a
//! different table name (`[[rule]]` where the loader reads `[[grants]]`)
//! is INVALID naming both: no evidence is not a pass.

**Seeds bootstrap. The live instance runs on its data. The tenant repo
is bootstrap + export.** Decided on design `e187198f` (David,
2026-09-18): "move away from seeds mattering, except to help OSS users
bootstrap and/or to support playground; our actual BOSS instance should
be flexible to use data instead of seeds."

What it measured. `boss tenant publish` runs at EVERY services-container
start (the launcher, `infra/seed-tenant.sh`), and on 2026-09-18 four
doors overwrote a live row on every run — business calendars wholesale,
the company label, an employee's declared fields, an agent's whole row —
so an operator's edit to any of them lived exactly until the next boot.
Four other registries (classes, sensors, policy, workflows) kept the
live row and said NOTHING when the file differed, so a repo edit that
never landed was dead text. The rule this section replaces — "the
tenant's declaration wins on declared fields" (backlog `09887242`,
2026-09-17) — was measured on a repo-edited location that had not
landed, the bootstrap case; on a running instance the same overlay was
the collision. It is dropped.

How it lands.

- **Every door is insert-if-absent by default.** A row the instance
  holds is never changed by a plain publish. Each batch route takes
  `?mode=insert-if-absent|take` where its semantics live (the calendar
  and agents batches, the company mint); the employee overlay PUTs, the
  Class edit door is used, policy's `force` is set and a workflow is
  superseded only under the matching `--take`.
- **`boss tenant publish --take <registry>[,<registry>]` is the only
  overwrite.** It names `classes`, `calendars`, `company`, `policy`,
  `employees`, `agents` or `workflows`; every other door stays
  insert-if-absent on that run, and a name no door can take is refused
  with the list. Every take prints the overwritten rows field by field:
  `updated 1: <id> (location loc-hq → loc-algedonic-hq)`.
- **Every registry's line names its kept-but-differing rows**, in one
  shape: `kept: <id> differs on <fields> (the instance is the truth;
  --take <registry> overwrites)`. A registry no door overwrites
  (sensors, credentials, locations, the chart, the ledger's rules, the
  reactors) says so instead of naming a flag. This line is the decision
  surface: the operator reads what the repo says differently and
  chooses to take it, to export the instance into the repo, or to leave
  both as they are.
- **What a take does per registry.** `employees`: the row's declared
  keys are overlaid on the live row and PUT back through the people
  door (its own `people.employee.updated`), so a column the file does
  not carry rides unchanged; an explicit `null` in the file IS a
  declaration. `agents`: the declaration is the whole row (an omitted
  cap declares it unset); a declared alias another agent holds moves.
  `calendars`: header and closed-day set are replaced wholesale.
  `company`: the label. `classes`: each differing row is PUT through
  `PUT /api/classes/{kind}/{code}`. `policy`: each rule whose `scope`
  or `active` differs is re-POSTed. `workflows`: each kind whose file
  differs on a facet the drift lint compares (label, description,
  category, step count, titles, required fields, title templates) is
  published as a new version that supersedes the live one.
- **The launcher publishes once per database.** A successful publish
  records itself in `tenant_publishes` (through `BOSS_POSTGRES_URL`;
  `boss tenant published` reads it, the date first), and the services
  launcher publishes only while that stamp is absent — a fresh
  instance: the OSS quickstart, the playground, a switched database —
  or when `BOSS_TENANT_TAKE` names registries for one boot. A running
  instance's boot prints one line: `tenant published <date>; the
  instance is the truth; publish --take to overwrite`. The verb an
  operator runs reads no stamp: `boss tenant publish <dir>` after it
  still inserts absent rows, which is how a row authored in the repo
  reaches a running instance (backlog `6a8d4972`).
- **A row the tenant does not declare is never deleted**, under either
  mode, and a second publish of an unchanged directory writes nothing
  and names nothing.

The playground published its example tenant at every boot until the
stamp (car 2); with insert-if-absent as the default that publish
changed nothing on a running instance, and now it does not run at all
there.

**`boss tenant export <dir>` writes the live registries back into this
shape** (car 3, backlog `e618f3ac`) — the inverse of `check`'s loaders,
so the exported directory is OK on every row and a publish of it back
into the same instance writes nothing. Deterministic: rows and keys
sorted, one formatting, nulls and defaults omitted, so exporting an
unchanged instance into the directory it last wrote changes no file;
the verb prints `added` / `changed` / `unchanged` / `skipped` per file
and never deletes one. A registry that marks ownership is exported for
the tenant only (Workflows by `owning_team`, dispatcher and posting
rules by `source`, sensors by `tenant_id`); one that does not (classes,
locations, the chart, tax, calendars, policy, credentials, projections)
is exported whole, platform rows included. Two files are not rewritten
wholesale because the instance does not hold everything they say:
`tenant.toml` has only its `display_name` line set (to the company
Subject's label), and a rule's `why` is kept from the `seeds/rules.toml`
being overwritten — a rule with none gets a `why` saying so.

        r#"# {display} — a BOSS tenant

This directory is **{display}** described as a tenant of BOSS: what the
company is (its taxonomy, people, calendars, access rules) and how it
operates (its protocols). It lives OUTSIDE the product tree, in exactly
the shape the product reads: `tenant.toml` (the manifest) + `seeds/`.
The product's `examples/brewery` and `examples/used-device-shop`
exercise the same contract publicly.

Scaffolded by `boss tenant init {name}`. Validate it any time with
`boss tenant check .` — it judges every file with the product's own
loader and reports OK / MISSING / INVALID / UNKNOWN per file.

## The files

{files}
The full contract — every file the product reads from a tenant
directory, who reads it and its shape — is `docs/tenant-contract.md`
in the product repo.

## Rules

- **No secrets, ever.** Credentials live in the deployment's secret
  store and are referenced by name.
- Business data that is *work* (an order, a request, an invoice) is
  packets in the system of record, not files here. This directory holds
  *declarations* — what the company is and how it operates — so a change
  to it is a pull request with a diff to approve.
- A protocol grows by publishing a new `[[workflow]]` version, never by
  editing the product.
