//! `boss dispatch <packet> [--step <slug>] [--model M --budget B
//! --effort E]` — hand a protocol step to an agent, as a packet.
//!
//! `boss dispatch --next --station <name>` is the same verb taking its
//! packet from a QUEUE instead of from the caller (design 8382bbb2,
//! backlog 923b6571) — the durable inbox. See the section above
//! [`next_at`] for why that is the whole difference that matters.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A VERB (design c87fb59b, decided 2026-09-18; car 2,
//! backlog 39d0b528). Until this landed, dispatching a builder was
//! five hand acts in the operator's terminal: read the packet, write a
//! brief, paste a rules file from /tmp, pick a model and a budget from
//! memory, and paste the lot into the Agent tool — and the run itself
//! existed nowhere in the record. Car 1 put the model, the budget and
//! the effort on the step's own Workflow row as its `agent` block; this
//! verb is the door that READS it, so a run takes the protocol's
//! settings and the record says so.
//!
//! WHAT IT DOES, in order — and each write is confirmed by reading it
//! back, the rule every filing verb here follows:
//!
//! 1. Reads the packet and picks the step: `--step <slug>`, or the one
//!    step the packet is AT when there is exactly one (two open steps
//!    is a refusal that lists them).
//! 2. Resolves the step's agent block. The packet first — car 1
//!    projects the block onto the materialised step as `agent_profile`
//!    / `agent_model` / `agent_budget_usd` / `agent_effort`, and "the
//!    claim door reads the packet, never the spec" is that car's own
//!    rule — then the ACTIVE Workflow row's step, for a packet
//!    materialised before the row declared one (this packet's own
//!    `build` was: opened 17:33, the block landed 18:11). Neither is a
//!    REFUSAL that names the fix: add `agent = { profile = …, model =
//!    …, budget_usd = …, effort = … }` to the step in its Workflow row.
//!    `--model`, `--budget`, `--effort` OVERRIDE only what they name;
//!    a model the rate card cannot price and an effort outside
//!    low|medium|high are refused the way the publish lint refuses
//!    them, so a run is never priced against nothing.
//!    THE HOSTING DOOR sits between 1 and 2 (a479faf7; design 01c3cc3f
//!    reader 3): a packet that declares the paths its change will
//!    touch (`metadata.paths`) is judged against the instance's edit
//!    level (`GET /api/tenant/edit-level`, the tenant manifest's
//!    `[meta] edit_level`) with the one predicate the gate's lint also
//!    reads, `boss_core::tiers::TierMap::first_above` — refused before
//!    an agent spends, naming the first path, its tier and the level.
//!    A packet declaring no paths is admitted here; the gate decides
//!    on the diff. An instance declaring no level enforces nothing.
//!    THE VENUE DOOR follows the block (backlog 10b07b73): a packet
//!    whose `metadata.tenant_repo` names another repository is refused
//!    for a `car`-lane profile, whose worktree, gate and probe are all
//!    this tree's ([`venue_refusal`]).
//! 3. Claims the step as the actor running the verb (`BOSS_ACTOR`;
//!    unnamed, the claim is refused before anything is filed) through
//!    the claim door — a Ready→Active compare-and-set that answers 409
//!    with the holder, so two operators dispatching one step is a
//!    refusal naming the other, not two runs.
//! 4. Files the `agent-run` packet with the settings, the actor, the
//!    worktree and the host on it, and the rendered brief as `brief`
//!    — the record of what the agent was told.
//! 5. Prints the EXACT prompt: `boss brief`'s rendering (the packet,
//!    the invariants, the rules document for the profile) and the run
//!    id — what the operator pastes into the Agent tool today and what
//!    a runner reads later — and completes the run's `briefed` step
//!    with the prompt's size, so the run is at `building` the moment
//!    the prompt exists.
//!
//! THE EFFORT SELECTS THE CPU (backlog e720dd00, 2026-09-19). The
//! block's `effort` was resolved, validated, written onto the run
//! packet and printed in the prompt — and applied by nothing: the
//! harness takes reasoning effort from an agent DEFINITION, and there
//! were none, so every builder recorded `effort = high` and ran at the
//! session default. A packet asserting a property of a run that is not
//! true of that run is the mostly-sure shape the correctness protocol
//! refuses, and the honest repair is to make the declaration select
//! something. It now names a definition — `.claude/agents/effort-<v>.md`,
//! one per value [`boss_jobs::agent_spec::Effort`] admits, identical
//! but for the `effort:` line so a series across them varies reasoning
//! budget and nothing else — in the prompt ([`effort_line`]) and on the
//! Agent call itself, where the hook sets `subagent_type`
//! ([`crate::dispatch_hook::updated_input`]). What that buys is
//! "declared and NAMED", not "provably applied": that the harness
//! honours the key is attested by its documentation (sub-agents,
//! Advanced Fields, v2.1.278), and a model cannot introspect its own
//! thinking budget, so no probe available to us measures the effort
//! took. The tests pin what is checkable — a definition for every
//! declarable effort, its effort matching its name, its model fixed,
//! and the prompt naming the right one.
//!
//! The prompt goes to stdout and every status line to stderr, so
//! `boss dispatch <packet> > prompt.txt` is the prompt and nothing else.
//!
//! `boss dispatch --report <run> --summary S [--spend-usd D] [--tokens
//! N | IN,OUT]` is the OTHER end of the run (car 3, backlog cb78818d —
//! car 2's second loose end): the builder's handback, recorded by the
//! operator who read it today and by the runner later. It writes the
//! report onto the run packet (`report`, `spend_usd`, `tokens` — the
//! keys the agent-run schema names for a later hand), completes the
//! run's `reported` step when the green has opened it (the run lands
//! on that), and records the finish in `agent_runs` — the row the claim
//! door reads an actor's hour-window spend from, priced by the rate
//! card at its two rates when the tokens are a split and at the model's
//! declared blend when they are a total, with the basis named either
//! way (`PricingBasis`; design 91a9bfe7). Idempotent end to end: the packet PATCH
//! merges, a completed `reported` is left as it is, and the run row is
//! keyed on the run's id. That last key is INSERT-ONCE, so a second
//! report changes no row: an identical retry says the record already
//! there stands, and one carrying a different count is refused naming
//! both figures, rather than printing the held row's price as though
//! it were this command's answer ([`record_line`], backlog b4fd594e).

/// 6 named a `partial_item` and 7 named a `no_item_reason`, so every
/// one of them answered the question `require_item_answer` asks, and
/// not one of the 175 left its item open once the CAR closed. Both of
/// these cars named their packet correctly.
///
/// What they had in common is that they were still `open` at `Proven in
/// prod`: `ship-a-change` reaches `merged` off `steps.proven.done`, so
/// an unproven car never closes, `jobs.complete_linked_step` never
/// fires, and the item stays open for as long as the proof takes.
/// Twelve such cars were standing that morning, the oldest landed 58 h
/// earlier, holding ten open items between them — a population, not two
/// accidents, and the queue an automated runner drains.
///
/// So the question here is answered from the RECORD, never from the
/// tree: does a car naming this packet already satisfy
/// `boss_jobs::car::is_landed`? That is the same predicate `boss gate`
/// and the auto-park handler ask before filing a twin, and it is the
/// only "is this already fixed" question that can be answered without
/// reading code and guessing at it.
///

/// claimed and the run is filed. Send stdout to /dev/null and the claim
/// and the run survive while the only copy of the thing they exist to

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The durable inbox — `boss dispatch --next --station <name>`
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHY (design 8382bbb2, backlog 923b6571, decided 2026-09-19). Until
// this, a dispatch lived in the session that made it: `boss dispatch
// <packet>` printed a prompt and the session held the thread, so when
// the session died at ~15:39Z on 2026-09-19 fifteen `agent-run`
// packets were orphaned — twelve green but never handed back, three
// with a prompt printed and no executor ever started — and recovery
// was by hand.
//
// The fix is not a coordinator. The QUEUE already exists as data: a
// step declaring an `agent` block under a role projects an
// `a.<role>.<model-slug>` station (`station_projection::agent_stations`),
// and the packet sits in it while the step is ready. What was missing
// was the door OUT of it — this verb, which asks the record what is
// waiting and takes the first piece of it. Nothing is handed from the
// process that filed the work to the one that runs it; the record is
// the whole hand-off, which is what makes the work outlive either.
//
// The station is NAMED, never inferred. An agents row's `role` is a
// Class code (`engineering-agent` on this instance) and a station's
// role is the step's `authority_role` (`platform-admin`); nothing
// reconciles the two, so guessing an actor's inbox from its row would
// resolve a queue that does not exist and answer "nothing waiting"
// instead of erroring — the wrong-target shape CLAUDE.md warns about.

/// The step an inbox hands out: ready, nobody's, and declaring an
/// agent block — through [`settings_for`], the packet's projection
/// else `row`'s step (the kind's ACTIVE row). That is exactly what made
/// the packet a member of an `a.<role>.<model>` station since backlog
/// 51aef4dd resolved membership against the active row, so the verb
/// selects on the same fact the queue did rather than a second opinion
/// about it. Selecting on the projection alone would read a queue of
/// 47 pinned page-audit packets and take none of them.
///
/// ACTIVE steps are deliberately not candidates although the station
/// holds them (a queue shows what is being worked as well as what is
/// waiting): they are somebody's, and the claim would 409.
