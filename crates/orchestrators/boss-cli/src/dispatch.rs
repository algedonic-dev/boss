//! `boss dispatch <packet> [--step <slug>] [--model M --budget B
//! --effort E]` — hand a protocol step to an agent, as a packet.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A VERB (design c87fb59b, decided 2026-09-18; car 2,
//! backlog 39d0b528). Until this landed, dispatching a builder was
//! five hand acts in the operator's terminal: read the packet, write a
//! brief, paste a rules file from /tmp, pick a model and a budget from
//! memory, and paste the lot into the Agent tool — and the run itself
//! existed nowhere in the record. Car 1 put the model, the budget and
//! the effort on the step's own Workflow row as its `agent` block; this
//! verb is the door that READS it, so a run takes the protocol's
//! settings and the record says so.
//!
//! WHAT IT DOES, in order — and each write is confirmed by reading it
//! back, the rule every filing verb here follows:
//!
//! 1. Reads the packet and picks the step: `--step <slug>`, or the one
//!    step the packet is AT when there is exactly one (two open steps
//!    is a refusal that lists them).
//! 2. Resolves the step's agent block. The packet first — car 1
//!    projects the block onto the materialised step as `agent_profile`
//!    / `agent_model` / `agent_budget_usd` / `agent_effort`, and "the
//!    claim door reads the packet, never the spec" is that car's own
//!    rule — then the ACTIVE Workflow row's step, for a packet
//!    materialised before the row declared one (this packet's own
//!    `build` was: opened 17:33, the block landed 18:11). Neither is a
//!    REFUSAL that names the fix: add `agent = { profile = …, model =
//!    …, budget_usd = …, effort = … }` to the step in its Workflow row.
//!    `--model`, `--budget`, `--effort` OVERRIDE only what they name;
//!    a model the rate card cannot price and an effort outside
//!    low|medium|high are refused the way the publish lint refuses
//!    them, so a run is never priced against nothing.
//! 3. Claims the step as the actor running the verb (`BOSS_ACTOR`;
//!    unnamed, the claim is refused before anything is filed) through
//!    the claim door — a Ready→Active compare-and-set that answers 409
//!    with the holder, so two operators dispatching one step is a
//!    refusal naming the other, not two runs.
//! 4. Files the `agent-run` packet with the settings, the actor, the
//!    worktree and the host on it, and the rendered brief as `brief`
//!    — the record of what the agent was told.
//! 5. Prints the EXACT prompt: `boss brief`'s rendering (the packet,
//!    the invariants, the rules document for the profile) and the run
//!    id — what the operator pastes into the Agent tool today and what
//!    a runner reads later — and completes the run's `briefed` step
//!    with the prompt's size, so the run is at `building` the moment
//!    the prompt exists.
//!
//! The prompt goes to stdout and every status line to stderr, so
//! `boss dispatch <packet> > prompt.txt` is the prompt and nothing else.
//!
//! `boss dispatch --report <run> --summary S [--spend-usd D] [--tokens
//! N | IN,OUT]` is the OTHER end of the run (car 3, backlog cb78818d —
//! car 2's second loose end): the builder's handback, recorded by the
//! operator who read it today and by the runner later. It writes the
//! report onto the run packet (`report`, `spend_usd`, `tokens` — the
//! keys the agent-run schema names for a later hand), completes the
//! run's `reported` step when the green has opened it (the run lands
//! on that), and records the finish in `agent_runs` — the row the claim
//! door reads an actor's hour-window spend from, priced by the rate
//! card when the tokens are a split, unpriced when they are a total
//! (`TokenUsage`'s own rule). Idempotent end to end: the packet PATCH
//! merges, a completed `reported` is left as it is, and the run row is
//! keyed on the run's id.
