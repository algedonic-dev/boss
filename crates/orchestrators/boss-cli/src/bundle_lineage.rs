//! Where a registry bundle FILE stands against its LIVE lineage — said
//! before an author bumps a version from the file (backlog 5449111c).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. A versioned bundle file may sit behind its live
//! lineage by design: an operator who re-versions a rule live leaves
//! the file behind, and the seed reports it as information, never a
//! refusal (`boss_jobs::cadence_seed`). The consequence nobody drew is
//! at the OTHER end. The next author bumps the version FROM THE FILE,
//! because the file is the declared home and the file is what a gate
//! reads — and when the file is behind, "bump the version" produces a
//! version that already exists live with different columns, the one
//! thing the seed refuses. Measured 2026-09-21 on the boarding
//! cooldown (3ec04168): the bundle said v6, the live lineage was at
//! v7, the car bumped 6 -> 7 and declared cooldown 30, gated green,
//! rode a train and landed — and the live row still read cooldown 45
//! at v7 active. Every check in the gate reads files; a green gate
//! proves the file, and nothing proved the row. `train-window` sat
//! the same way that day (bundle v2, live v3 active), the next change
//! to it one bump from the same collision.
//!
//! THE JUDGEMENT IS THE SEED'S, NOT A SECOND COPY. Each bundle row is
//! put through `boss_jobs::bundle_seed::decide` — the decision table
//! the boot runs — against the lineage the system of record answers
//! today: a dry run of the next boot, read at the moment it matters.
//! This module only says which of the seed's outcomes an AUTHOR must
//! hear about, and in what words. It changes no refusal and writes
//! nothing; letting a boot reconcile a behind file upward is ruled
//! out on the record in the packet, since that is a boot overwriting
//! an operator's live decision.
//!
//! GENERIC OVER `Declared`, and the sweep joined through it: cadence
//! first (the registry where the collision was measured), then
//! stations and step plugins, whose files declare their version the
//! same way and so can collide the same way — each read by its own
//! loader and its own lineage route, never a guessed key.
//!
//! AND AT THE ONE DOOR EVERY CAR PASSES (the closing car of 5449111c).
//! orient says it to whoever reads orient; the 3ec04168 car was built
//! by a briefed builder, who never does. The gap the packet named is
//! that a green gate proves the file and nothing proves the row — so
//! `boss gate`, which already reads the system of record before it
//! files anything, puts every bundle row the CAR CHANGES through the
//! same `lineage_line` against the live lineage, and refuses the launch
//! when live will not take the row as written: it contradicts a live
//! version, sits behind the live newest, or names a lineage an operator
//! retired. Only a changed DECLARATION is judged (a comment edit on a
//! file that is behind by design stays possible), only the car's own
//! files (nothing another car or an operator did can red this one), and
//! an unread lineage PROCEEDS with a line — "cannot answer" is not
//! "collides", and this is the door every car passes. Every refusal
//! has a way through that is not an override: declare the live newest
//! plus one, or publish live first so the file writes back a row that
//! is already present. Shape 3 of the packet, scoped to the change
//! rather than the tree; shape 2 (a boot filing a packet) is answered
//! by these two readers instead of a third, since a boot reporting
//! through the API it boots is the arm that needs the patient.
