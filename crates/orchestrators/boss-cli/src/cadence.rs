//! `boss train cadence` — the conductor's cadence as protocol data.
//!
//! The train's scheduling knowledge used to live in two systemd
//! timers (06:00/18:00 boarding, 10-minute reconcile) — outside the
//! system, invisible to the log, changeable only by an operator with
//! sudo. Per docs/design/protocol-cadence.md (David, 2026-08-12,
//! bacca14e: "We want every protocol internalized so we can measure,
//! experiment, and update"), the schedule is now rows in the
//! `cadence_rules` registry (114-cadence-rules.sql): each rule names
//! the `boss train` verb it fires, its basis — `wall` (interval),
//! `clock` (times-of-day), `queue-depth` (parked ready cars) — and
//! the basis' parameters. This loop is the executor: each tick it
//! reads boss-clock time (never wall-clock — the no-wallclock lint's
//! invariant), evaluates the active rules, claims a deterministic
//! firing row (`cadence:<name>:<window-stamp>`), and runs the verb
//! as a child of this same binary. systemd is demoted to what an OS
//! is for: keeping this process alive (infra/train/boss-train.service).
//!
//! Exactly-once, restated as data: the firing id is a pure function
//! of (rule, window), so a re-evaluated tick, a restarted loop, or a
//! second cadence instance all compute the same id and the
//! `cadence_firings` primary key dedupes the claim. Catch-up after
//! downtime fires at most the single most-recent missed window per
//! rule — a deliberate no-thundering-backfill choice matching the
//! conductor's one-window-at-a-time cadence (protocol-cadence Q3).
//!
//! **A verb runs beside the loop, never inside it.** Job 9c5871fa
//! (2026-08-13 10:00–10:20Z): a reconcile that deployed took 30+
//! minutes — a core-crate change forces a full workspace rebuild —
//! and because the tick awaited it inline, nothing else fired for
//! that whole window: no later reconcile, no queue-depth evaluation,
//! and no heartbeat. The scheduler went deaf exactly when an operator
//! most wanted to know it was alive. So a firing now spawns its verb
//! as a tracked task (`Runs`) and the tick returns; the task waits on
//! the child, journals the completion line, and merges rc + runtime
//! into the row it already claimed.
//!
//! What replaces the old "one verb at a time" serialization is a
//! guard scoped to what actually needs it: **one in-flight run per
//! rule**. A rule whose previous firing is still going skips its next
//! window loudly (`<rule> still running (<n>s) — not re-firing`) and
//! claims nothing. DIFFERENT rules may overlap on purpose — the
//! conductor's flock is the arbiter of whether two verbs can really
//! proceed, and its "another conductor run holds the lock — leaving"
//! is the correct, already-designed outcome for the loser. A second
//! lock in this loop would only re-implement it worse.
