//! `boss train cadence` — the conductor's cadence as protocol data.
//!
//! The train's scheduling knowledge used to live in two systemd
//! timers (06:00/18:00 boarding, 10-minute reconcile) — outside the
//! system, invisible to the log, changeable only by an operator with
//! sudo. Per docs/design/protocol-cadence.md (David, 2026-08-12,
//! bacca14e: "We want every protocol internalized so we can measure,
//! experiment, and update"), the schedule is now rows in the
//! `cadence_rules` registry (114-cadence-rules.sql): each rule names
//! the `boss train` verb it fires, its basis — `wall` (interval),
//! `clock` (times-of-day), `queue-depth` (parked ready cars) — and
//! the basis' parameters. This loop is the executor: each tick it
//! reads boss-clock time (never wall-clock — the no-wallclock lint's
//! invariant), evaluates the active rules, claims a deterministic
//! firing row (`cadence:<name>:<window-stamp>`), and runs the verb
//! as a child of this same binary. systemd is demoted to what an OS
//! is for: keeping this process alive (infra/train/boss-train.service).
//!
//! ALL OF THAT RIDES `/api/cadence/*` — the jobs API is the loop's
//! one door for rules, last-firings, claims and outcomes
//! (protocol-cadence.md, sequencing step 3; backlog a516f1f1). The
//! loop used to open its own sqlx pool, and BOSS_POSTGRES_URL on the
//! conductor's host named a DIFFERENT database than the system of
//! record — so `/api/cadence/rules/{name}/last-firing` answered
//! `null` ("never fired") for every rule while the loop fired on
//! schedule. One door, one database: the firings the loop records are
//! the firings the operator reads.
//!
//! Exactly-once, restated as data: the firing id is a pure function
//! of (rule, window), so a re-evaluated tick, a restarted loop, or a
//! second cadence instance all compute the same id and the
//! `cadence_firings` primary key dedupes the claim. Catch-up after
//! downtime fires at most the single most-recent missed window per
//! rule — a deliberate no-thundering-backfill choice matching the
//! conductor's one-window-at-a-time cadence (protocol-cadence Q3).
//!
//! **A verb runs beside the loop, never inside it.** Job 9c5871fa
//! (2026-08-13 10:00–10:20Z): a reconcile that deployed took 30+
//! minutes — a core-crate change forces a full workspace rebuild —
//! and because the tick awaited it inline, nothing else fired for
//! that whole window: no later reconcile, no queue-depth evaluation,
//! and no heartbeat. The scheduler went deaf exactly when an operator
//! most wanted to know it was alive. So a firing now spawns its verb
//! as a tracked task (`Runs`) and the tick returns; the task waits on
//! the child, journals the completion line, and merges rc + runtime
//! into the row it already claimed.
//!
//! What replaces the old "one verb at a time" serialization is a
//! guard scoped to what actually needs it: **one in-flight run per
//! rule**. A rule whose previous firing is still going skips its next
//! window loudly (`<rule> still running (<n>s) — not re-firing`) and
//! claims nothing. DIFFERENT rules may overlap on purpose — the
//! conductor's flock is the arbiter of whether two verbs can really
//! proceed, and leaving is the correct outcome for a loser that will
//! get another turn. A second lock in this loop would only re-implement
//! it worse.
//!
//! What that reading missed, and cost ten hours on 2026-09-10
//! (4860aff8): a loser only "gets another turn" if it can eventually
//! WIN. The 60-second board holds the flock 12–14s in the consist
//! check; the 10-minute reconcile fires a second later, lost 55 times
//! in a row, and every merge, arrival report, stall check and branch
//! sweep stopped for nine hours. The flock is still the arbiter — it
//! now gives a starvable phase a bounded wait rather than an immediate
//! exit (`train::lock_wait_budget`), and records a pass that waited its
//! whole budget as a NONZERO rc so a starved loop stops reading as a
//! 0-second success in this loop's own firing rows.
