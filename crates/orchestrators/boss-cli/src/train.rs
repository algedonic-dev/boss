//! `boss train` — drive the pr-train Workflow.
//!
//! Ported from `infra/train/conductor.py` (directive 26d61c97: no
//! python runs the BOSS system — the conductor's logic now lives in
//! the same `boss` binary the box already ships). The semantics, the
//! journal lines, and the incident history below are the python
//! conductor's, carried over intact.
//!
//! The train is the cadence: changes accumulate on branches with their
//! ship-a-change Jobs parked at `review`, and twice a day this runs and
//! does the batching a person used to do by discipline. Two phases:
//!
//!  1. RECONCILE — for every OPEN pr-train Job, record whatever evidence
//!     arrived since the last run: the CI verdict (polled from the
//!     forge), the merge (observed, never assumed), and the deploys that
//!     carried the merge out. Steps close only when the conductor holds
//!     the evidence in hand; a train whose PR nobody merged just stays
//!     open, visibly. Once a train has arrived, the sweep deletes each
//!     landed car's branch from the forge — on the job record's
//!     evidence, because squash-merged trains leave no git ancestry to
//!     prove a landing (see `deletable_branches`), and only while the
//!     branch still points at the head that boarded (`sweep_guard`).
//!     The train's OWN branch comes off the same way at arrival
//!     (`arrival_branch_to_delete`): the internal forge keeps merged
//!     PR heads, and 62 stale `train/*` branches piled up in a week
//!     before arrival owned its own housekeeping (ab3fa473).
//!
//!  2. BOARD — collect the ship-a-change Jobs that are ready (review
//!     step ready/active, a branch pushed to the fork, not already on a
//!     train), assemble one train branch by merging each on top of
//!     origin/main, run the CONSIST CHECK over the assembled tree
//!     (`consist_check` — seconds of cheap text lints, because a
//!     per-branch gate cannot see a failure that exists only in the
//!     combination), push it, THEN open this window's train Job, then
//!     ONE batched PR.
//!     A branch that does not merge cleanly is skipped, named on the Job,
//!     and left for the next train. An empty window — or a consist the
//!     check refused — departs nothing and OPENS NO PACKET: the journal
//!     says why in one `no train departed` line and each car keeps its
//!     own `skip_reason`. A refusal strikes no car (see "A BOARD THAT
//!     DEPARTS NO TRAIN OPENS NO PACKET" for the ten hours that bought
//!     the ordering).
//!
//! Two trees, deliberately:
//!   - assembly happens in a dedicated clone (BOSS_TRAIN_HOME/repo) —
//!     never in the dev working tree, which may hold a session's
//!     half-built work;
//!   - deploys run from the dev tree (/opt/boss) only when it is clean
//!     and on main; otherwise the deploy is left pending with the reason
//!     recorded, and the next run retries.
//!
//! Talks to jobs-api directly with an actor header (the gateway strips
//! inbound identity, same as boss-step.sh). Steps are addressed by
//! `spec_slug` with a title fallback for steps that predate the column.
//!
//! THIS FILE EXECUTES. IT DOES NOT DECIDE.
//! The thresholds, budgets and rosters the conductor works to are
//! registry data, read once per invocation and threaded through
//! `Conductor::policy` — see `crate::delivery_policy`, which is the only
//! place a policy number is written down in Rust (and only as the
//! fallback for a registry that cannot be reached). If you are looking
//! for "how many strikes hold a car" or "which lints run on a consist",
//! it is a row, not a constant (docs/design/delivery-as-protocol.md).

// The consist check — proving the ASSEMBLED tree before spending CI on it
//
// Pre-flight above checks the LOCOMOTIVE. This checks the CONSIST, and
// it exists because of a number: train arrival went 100% (08-20) → 40%
// (08-23) → 0% (08-24) as cars-per-train rose. Every failure in the last
// two days was a COMBINATION failure — invisible to a per-branch gate,
// because on each branch alone there was nothing wrong:
//
//   - two cars each added `infra/postgres/schema/153-*.sql`. Unique on
//     either branch; a duplicate the moment they were assembled.
//   - a new lint (`infra/lint/one-palette.sh`) and the mocked spec that
//     has to NAME the forbidden pattern in order to test it rode the
//     same train. The lint failed on the spec.
//
// Each cost roughly 90 minutes of CI to learn ONE bit, plus a cancel,
// plus a strike on every innocent car aboard. So the conductor asks the
// cheap questions itself, against the tree it just assembled, before it
// spends anything. Three rules keep it from becoming the thing it is
// meant to save:
//
//   - CHEAP ONLY. Text lints, run out of the assembled `infra/lint/`.
//     No cargo, no bun, no database. Measured: the 23 included scripts
//     total ~9 seconds. The full gate is what CI is for; this is not a
//     second gate and must never grow into one.
//   - DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED. Every `infra/lint/*.sh` in the ASSEMBLED
//     tree runs, minus a named exclusion set — which is the whole point
//     of the second failure above: the lint that catches the next
//     combination failure may be arriving ON THE TRAIN, and no
//     hand-picked pair in this file could have seen it.
//   - TAME WHEN IT BREAKS ITSELF. Missing, unrunnable, or over budget
//     is a logged warning and the train departs. A preflight that
//     becomes a new way to block every train costs more than it saves.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do is decide whose fault the failure
// was. Nobody's: each car was green alone. So a refusal opens no PR,
// strikes no car, and leaves every one of them boardable carrying a
// reason that names the lint and the files.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ONE car sat on the dock that the consist check refused. The board
// cadence is queue-depth based and re-fires every 60 seconds while the
// dock stays deep, and every attempt OPENED a pr-train Job and then
// cancelled it: `pr-train` total passed 982, the newest 100 rows all
// closed inside 99 minutes, 89 `outcome: cancelled`, and 100 of 100
// with no `boarded_jobs`. That is ~1,440 phantom packets a day from one
// unboardable car. It turned the branch sweep's 50-row window over in
// under an hour (02069932) and it lied to every window read — the yard,
// `boss orient`, and any count of how many trains ran.
//
// The refusal itself was already right: no PR opened, no CI spent. What
// it did not skip was the PACKET, because the Job was created BEFORE
// the check ran — for one reason, that the refusal wanted somewhere to
// record itself. The record is cheaper than that:
//
//   - each car keeps its own `skip_reason`, and for a consist refusal
//     the structured `consist_refusal` too — the lint output, on the
//     car whose boarding it blocked, where the operator already looks;

// ordering constraint (backlog d3320278; design doc 364f892e, all three
// questions accepted as proposed). `fix/the-reclaim-follows-the-build`
// was gated `--hold` and parked by hand when the dock happened to be
// empty, purely so it would board SOLO as a gate-blind ci.yml change;
// `feat/a-deleted-manifest-leaves-no-object` spent a day waiting for a
// human to notice both halves of a two-part sequence were satisfied. The
// operator WAS the mechanism, and the mechanism was re-reading the dock.
//
// FILTER, DO NOT PLAN (decision 3). Boarding skips a car whose declared
// predecessor has not landed; it does not compute a multi-train
// sequence. A plan buys nothing the filter does not, because the next
// board happens on its own inside the cooldown. If the dock ever grows
// deep enough that planning is visibly better, that is a second car.
//
// AN UNSATISFIABLE EDGE REFUSES AND IS NAMED (decision 2). Boarding
// anyway after a timeout was rejected: it reintroduces exactly the
// collision the edge prevents. So the refusal is LOUD on every 60-second
// board attempt, and it is FOUR refusals rather than one, because an
// operator reading the dock is deciding whether the pipeline is stuck:
//
//   still in flight  — nobody does anything; it departs on its own
//   landed           — satisfied; the car boards (no refusal at all)
//   abandoned        — a human must break the edge; it will never clear
//   no such Job      — a human must fix the reference
//
// Collapsing those into "dependency not met" would build the quiet hold
// this feature exists to remove (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: quiet is a loan
// against the next diagnosis).
//
// AND IT MUST NEVER FREEZE A LANDING. A fallible read inside the board
// loop that refused everything it could not evaluate would stop every
// train, and the gate does not run the conductor, so the gate would not
// catch it. Every way the read can fail therefore DEGRADES TOWARD
// BOARDING, loudly: `Unreadable` is a journal line and the car rides.
// The edge's job is to stop a known collision, not to become a new way
// for the pipeline to stop.

/// 2. `refs/heads/<branch>` — a LOCAL ref in the conductor's own

///    the `gcp` remote IS /var/lib/boss-train/repo. The ref lands here
///    on no remote, and the car was skipped while its branch sat in

///    from this very directory, with the credentials the conductor
///    already holds. The old comment called a branch in neither place
///    "never pushed at all", which stopped being true the moment
///    anyone could push to this clone directly.

/// was listed first". Until 2026-08-17 this returned on the first ref

// A red verdict names its LOG, not just its check (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis,
// "a verdict must name what failed"). Naming `test` is half the answer;
// the operator still had to go re-derive WHY. These pure helpers turn a
// failing check into the id of the job that failed and a bounded tail of
// its log, resolving the id through the ONE endpoint that answers
// correctly. The forge seam does the fetching; everything decidable
// about a JSON payload is decided here, where it can be pinned.
//
// THE TRAP these encode around (live-confirmed 2026-09-06): the job log
// lives at `/actions/jobs/{JOB_ID}/logs`, but the JOB_ID must come from
// `/actions/runs/{run}/jobs` — NOT from `/actions/tasks`. A commit
// status's `target_url` is `…/actions/runs/{run}/jobs/{index}`, so it
// carries the run AND the job's position in that run: index into the
// run's jobs array and read its `id`. Reading the entry's `task_id`
// instead (the tasks-list id) silently returns a DIFFERENT job's log —
// run 462's failing `web` was job id 2008 / task_id 1939, and
// `jobs/1939/logs` was an unrelated SUCCESS. Position is unambiguous;
// name is only a cross-check.

// THE CONDUCTOR'S LOCK — A LOSER THAT LEAVES MUST EVENTUALLY WIN
//
// One lock file serializes every conductor verb, and the loser logs and
// leaves. That is correct for a verb with a designed retry, and wrong
// for one that can be starved — which is what happened for ten hours on
// 2026-09-10 (backlog 4860aff8):
//
//   - the board cadence fires every 60 seconds and spends 12–14 seconds
//     in the consist check, so it holds the lock for a fifth of every
//     minute while a car sits on the dock;
//   - the 10-minute reconcile fires about one second after it and so
//     lost the lock EVERY time — 55 consecutive "another conductor run
//     holds the lock — leaving", each recorded `rc=0 in 0s`;
//   - the reconcile is what merges a green train, runs the stall
//     sentinel, writes arrival reports and sweeps landed branches. All
//     four were dead for nine hours, and nothing said so, because
//     nothing needed a merge in that window. It surfaced when the next
//     car tried to land — the verb that lands a fix being the verb that
//     was starved.
//
// The contention is deterministic, not a race: the board always fires
// first and always wins. So the fix is not a bigger lock, it is
// FAIRNESS — the starvable side waits a bounded time for its turn:
//
//   - RECONCILE and RUN wait (`CONDUCTOR_LOCK_WAIT`). Waiting 14 seconds
//     out of a 600-second period costs nothing, and the cadence loop's
//     one-in-flight-run-per-rule guard means a waiting pass cannot stack
//     up behind itself.
//   - BOARD and PREFLIGHT do not wait. A board must never queue behind a
//     reconcile that is deploying (job 9c5871fa: 30+ minutes), and it
//     does not need to — its firing records boarded-nothing, which
//     releases the queue-depth cooldown, and the next tick re-fires.
//
// The two alternatives were weighed and rejected. Serializing board and
// reconcile into one cadence slot (`boss train run` already does
// reconcile-then-board) fixes only the pair of rules that happen to
// collide today and leaves every other caller — a hand-run verb, a
// second conductor — starvable by the same mechanism. Shortening the
// board's hold means shortening the consist check, which is the thing
// doing the work.
//
// The budget is a constant and not delivery-policy data deliberately:
// the lock is taken before the jobs API is read, so a registry value
// would have to be fetched by a run that has not yet proved it may run.
