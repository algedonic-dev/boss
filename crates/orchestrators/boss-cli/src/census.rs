//! `boss packet census` — measure packet conservation. Report only.
//!
//! docs/design/packet-loss.md proposes the invariant this measures:
//!
//! > Every admitted packet reaches a terminal, and every non-terminal
//! > packet is visible at ≥1 station.
//!
//! The first half is conservation over TIME (open vs terminal counts,
//! ages, and packets with no step motion). The second is conservation
//! over SPACE, and it is newly checkable because stations are registry
//! data: a packet matching zero station predicates is **orphaned by
//! definition** — no lens will present it, so no actor will work it.
//!
//! ## Reporting, not raising
//!
//! Q2 of the design doc defers raising until the base rate is known: a
//! noisy raiser trains people to ignore it. So this verb files nothing,
//! messages nobody, mutates nothing, and **exits 0 whatever it finds**.
//! Every read is a GET.
//!
//! ## Why it reuses the station evaluator instead of reimplementing it
//!
//! An orphan verdict that disagrees with `GET /api/stations/{name}/queue`
//! is worse than no verdict — it would send an operator hunting for a
//! packet the queue is in fact showing, or (worse) certify as visible a
//! packet nobody can see. So membership here is
//! [`StationPredicate::matches`], the same pure function the queue
//! handler calls, over the same universe the queue handler uses
//! (status=open Jobs). The two agreements that matter:
//!
//! - **Universe.** `http/stations.rs` filters `status = Open`. The
//!   census evaluates exactly the open set. Packets that are live but
//!   NOT at status=open (draft / blocked / pending-sign-off) are
//!   outside every station queue's universe by construction; they are
//!   counted and named in the time section rather than silently folded
//!   into the orphan number, because their invisibility has a different
//!   cause and a different fix.
//! - **Steps.** The handler fetches steps only when
//!   `predicate.needs_steps()` and passes an empty slice otherwise;
//!   `matches` ignores `steps` unless its `step` clause is set, so
//!   always passing the real steps (which `/api/jobs` already embeds)
//!   is observationally identical.
//!
//! One honest difference: the queue handler scopes packets to the
//! CALLER's policy predicate. The census reads as an operator, so it
//! sees the whole instance — an individual's queue may be a subset.
//! That is the point of a census.
//!
//! ## Edge integrity resolves the way the write path resolves
//!
//! Same argument, second surface. `job_edges` declarations are checked
//! by a Postgres trigger whose `job_edge_resolves()` is **prefix-aware**:
//! an exact id match, else an unambiguous prefix of length ≥ 8. Migration
//! 104 recorded why — `backlog_item` / `boarded_jobs` values are mostly
//! 8-char id prefixes, and 14 of ~15 dangle under exact match. A census
//! that checked exact ids only would report a dozen phantom danglings on
//! its first run. [`resolve`] mirrors the SQL, including its
//! "empty value = no claim" rule.
