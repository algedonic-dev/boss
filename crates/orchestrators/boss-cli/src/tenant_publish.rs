//! `boss tenant publish <dir> [--gateway <url>] [--dry-run]` — a tenant
//! with no engine is published through the shared doors (backlog
//! ee7b62bb).
//!
//! WHY. Measured 2026-09-16: a tenant was PUBLISHED into a running
//! deployment only by a tenant engine's prepare — the sim tenant's
//! (`<engine> prepare`, driven by its infra/seed-*-tenant.sh) and the
//! device shop's (crates/tenants/*). Both compose the same
//! shared doors (POST /api/classes/batch, the company Subject,
//! `boss_policy::bootstrap::publish_policy_rules`, POST /api/people in
//! two passes, `boss_jobs::bootstrap::publish_workflows`) around
//! engine-only data (accounts, vendors, messages, catalog, opening
//! balances). The real company's tenant (David's own tenant repo, the
//! first real customer of fcc1d57b) has no engine and never will — it
//! is a real company, load comes from the world — so nothing could
//! publish it. This verb is the engines' shared composition with the
//! engine-only data left out, which is what makes the cutover
//! (ffc83387) a tenant-source flip and not a rewrite of the sim
//! tenant's engine. (The tenants are not named here: the vocabulary
//! ratchet, be39298f, counts a tenant's name above its tier.)
//!
//! THE PLAN IS THE CONTRACT, IN DEPENDENCY ORDER. [`plan`] walks the
//! directory the way the engines' prepare does: classes (employee and
//! account writes validate against them) → the chart of accounts (the
//! ledger's rows, after the classes; backlog 41af5195) → the tax
//! regime (its kinds name accounts of the chart; backlog 7f163e58) →
//! locations (an
//! employee's `location` FKs into them; backlog 1ec8312a) → business
//! calendars →
//! the company Subject → policy grants → people (two passes: create,
//! then link managers) → agents (the machine half of the roster; a
//! step's audience may name one; backlog f56155f0) → Workflows, after
//! a barrier on the people projection (a publish opens design Jobs
//! whose role-bearing steps are assigned against the roster) →
//! credentials (knowledge about the secrets the deployment holds,
//! never a value; backlog ee368d0c) → sensors (a sensor names a
//! credential by id) → the ledger's posting rules → its event→fact projections
//! (a projection names the fact kind a rule posts and the workflow
//! whose step it reads; backlog a40541cb) → dispatcher rules LAST (the
//! tenant's own reactors, backlog 458971ef; a rule fires on the
//! protocols published before it, and its args may name the projection
//! rules too). Every file present in the directory gets a line: a door
//! and a count when publish writes it, `skipped: <why>` when nothing
//! reads it — never silence. `--dry-run` prints that plan and makes no
//! HTTP call.
//!
//! IT REFUSES BEFORE IT WRITES. The plan is built on [`tenant::check`]
//! and a directory with a MISSING or INVALID file is refused whole,
//! with the plan still printed so the operator sees every write beside
//! the file that blocks them. The doors read each file with the same
//! loader check does, so an INVALID file would fail the publish midway
//! and leave a half-published tenant. Under the launcher
//! (infra/seed-tenant.sh) that refusal is a DEGRADED pod that retries —
//! the contract tenant-launch.sh already holds.
//!
//! IDEMPOTENT, LIKE THE ENGINES. Every door inserts if absent: the
//! classes, chart, tax, locations, calendars, credentials, sensors and
//! ledger batches; the company Subject; policy GETs each rule before
//! it POSTs; an employee's 409 is followed by a GET and a comparison;
//! the workflow publish keeps a kind an authoring Job already
//! published; a dispatcher rule at its file's version is `present`. A
//! second run writes nothing new.
//!
//! THE INSTANCE IS THE TRUTH; `--take <registry>` OVERWRITES BY
//! DECISION (design e187198f, David 2026-09-18). Measured that day
//! (agent report on fed7a9e2): four doors overwrote a live row on
//! every republish — business calendars wholesale, the company label,
//! an employee's declared fields, an agent's whole row — and this verb
//! runs at every services-container start, so an operator's edit to
//! any of them lived until the next boot; four other registries
//! (classes, sensors, policy, workflows) kept the live row and said
//! NOTHING when the file differed, so a repo edit that never landed
//! was dead text. The rule of 09887242 ("the tenant's declaration
//! wins on declared fields", 2026-09-17) covered a repo-edited
//! location that had not landed — the bootstrap case — and is dropped:
//! seeds bootstrap an OSS install and the playground; the live
//! instance runs on its data; the repo is bootstrap + export. So every
//! door is insert-if-absent by default, each batch route takes
//! `?mode=insert-if-absent|take` where the semantics live, this verb
//! sends `take` ONLY for the registries named in `--take
//! <registry>[,<registry>]` (the employee overlay PUTs only under
//! `--take employees`; policy's `force` and the workflows' supersede
//! are their doors' takes), every take prints the overwritten rows
//! field by field, and EVERY registry's line names its kept-but-
//! differing rows in one shape — `kept: <id> differs on <fields> (the
//! instance is the truth; --take <registry> overwrites)` — as the
//! decision surface. The contract states it in docs/tenant-contract.md;
//! the decision is in docs/architecture-decisions.md.
//!
//! SIGNED, NOT SIMULATED. Every write carries `x-boss-user` as
//! `automation:tenant-seed` (platform-admin / operator — the tier the
//! doors gate on) and NOT `x-sim-origin`: the engines mark their seed
//! writes as a sim chain, which stamps the resulting events
//! `_simulated`, and the cutover TRIMS simulated rows. A real company's
//! declarations are real.
