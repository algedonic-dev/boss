//! `boss queue` — read the feedback triage board from a terminal.
//!
//! Ported from the python heredoc that lived in
//! `infra/feedback-queue.sh` (directive 26d61c97: no python runs the
//! BOSS system). The shell file survives as an exec shim for operator
//! muscle memory; its history lives on here.
//!
//! The board at /system/feedback is the operator's view; this is the
//! same thing for whoever is playing the agent. Read-only on purpose:
//! taking an item, annotating it, or closing it goes through the board
//! or the step API, so every state change carries an actor. A command
//! that could also write would make "who triaged this" ambiguous
//! exactly where the audit trail matters most.
//!
//! Columns are derived, not stored — same as the board. But this
//! derives them from facts the board does not own: a Job is done when
//! the JOB is closed, and it is with an agent when ANY step carries an
//! agent request.
//!
//! That is deliberate. The first version of this reader found the
//! triage step the way the board did at the time — by matching a step
//! kind — and drifted the same day, when the board switched to finding
//! it by its authority gate. The reader then reported a freshly-filed
//! item as already triaged, which is the worst way for a queue reader
//! to be wrong. Two copies of "how to find the triage step" is the
//! fact-that-lives-twice failure in CLAUDE.md §9a; the fix is not a
//! comment telling the next person to sync them, it is not needing the
//! rule here at all.
//!
//! Reads jobs-api directly rather than through the gateway. The
//! gateway is the BROWSER edge: it authenticates a session cookie and
//! strips every inbound `x-boss-*` header, so an operator tool has no
//! way to present itself there. Terminal tooling goes to the service
//! port with an actor header — the same path verify-smoke.sh and
//! verify-replay.sh take.
//!
//! The shell ancestor once curled the gateway anonymously. That worked
//! only because demo mode minted an `audit-readonly` session for
//! anyone who asked; when that was removed the reader started
//! returning 401 and a stack trace. Anonymous read was never the
//! contract, it was a side effect.
//!
//! (One failure mode the port retires outright: the python used to be
//! embedded in a double-quoted shell string, where a literal double
//! quote silently truncated the program — which is exactly how its
//! fork_step function broke on first write.)
