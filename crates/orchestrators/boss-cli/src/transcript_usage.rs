//! What a dispatched run CONSUMED, read from the harness's own
//! transcript of it (backlog e6b2066f).
//!
//! THE NUMBER THIS REPLACES. A builder's handback carried the harness's
//! `subagent_tokens`, and `boss dispatch --report --tokens` recorded it
//! as the run's `total_tokens` — priced at a blend, read by both budget
//! desks. It is the size of the run's FINAL context window: it matched
//! the last turn's four counts within 1% on 62 of 68 runs, while the
//! tokens the run was billed for, summed over every turn, were a median
//! 48x larger, 96.8% of them cache reads. Real spend was a median 4.9x
//! the recorded figure.
//!
//! THE NUMBER THAT WAS ALWAYS THERE. Claude Code writes every subagent's
//! turns to `<projects>/<project>/<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`,
//! and every assistant line carries the turn's `message.usage`:
//! `input_tokens` (uncached), `cache_creation_input_tokens`,
//! `cache_read_input_tokens` and `output_tokens`. [`sum_usage`] sums
//! those four over the run — reading the record rather than retyping a
//! figure from a handback, the "receipt copied, not retyped" rule.
//!
//! ONE TURN IS SEVERAL LINES. The harness writes a line per content
//! block (thinking, text, each tool call), each carrying the SAME
//! `message.id` and the same prompt counts, with `output_tokens` growing
//! as the turn streams. A naive sum counts a three-block turn three
//! times, so turns are keyed on `message.id` (else `requestId`) and each
//! count is the turn's largest — measured on this car's own transcript,
//! where one turn's lines read output 5, then 155.
//!
//! WHICH TRANSCRIPT. [`find_transcripts`] looks for the one whose text
//! holds `agent-run <run id>` — the phrase every run section prints
//! (`dispatch::run_section`), whether the prompt carried it or the
//! builder read it from a prompt file — among subagent transcripts
//! written since the run opened. Exactly one is the run's; none, or
//! more than one, is said out loud and the report falls back to the
//! count it was given, because guessing between two transcripts would
//! record one run's spend against another.
//!
//! WHICH MODEL. The same transcript says which model every turn was
//! billed as, so the record names that model rather than the one the
//! step's agent block declared ([`RunModels`], backlog 6bb85880).
