//! `boss publish-requests` — the conductor drains `publish-request`
//! packets (protocol filed as 0b1b32f9).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. A workspace with no forge credential cannot push a
//! branch, so `publish-request v1` lets it file a packet instead:
//! metadata `{branch, head_sha, base_sha, bundle_b64, requested_by}`,
//! steps `filed(trigger) → publish(task)`, terminals
//! `published/refused` forking on `steps.publish.metadata.result`. The
//! conductor — the one actor holding the forge credential — verifies
//! the bundle and pushes, or refuses with a reason on the packet.
//!
//! THE NAME AND THE CONTENT MUST NOT DISAGREE (e7b3a044). The packet
//! *names* a head (`head_sha`); the bundle *carries* content. Every
//! refusal that comes from those two disagreeing names both shas, so
//! the workspace that filed it can see exactly which half lied.
//!
//! NEVER FORCE-PUSH. A branch already on the forge at `head_sha` is a
//! success (the mission was the ref, not the transfer); at any other
//! sha it is a refusal. The forge's history is never rewritten by a
//! drain, whatever the packet asks.
//!
//! FAILURE POSTURE. A refusal is an ANSWER and completes the packet's
//! `publish` step with `result=refused`. An *error* (forge unreachable,
//! push rejected mid-race, jobs API away) is not an answer: the packet
//! stays open and the next drain cycle retries it. One poisoned packet
//! must not hold the queue, so per-packet errors are logged and the
//! loop moves on — the same posture the conductor's branch sweep takes.
