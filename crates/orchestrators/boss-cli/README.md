# `boss` CLI

The single operator + developer entry point for BOSS. Wraps the
service systemd units, the deploy-services script, the audit log,
and the agent runtime so day-to-day work goes through one
interface instead of a tour of `journalctl` / `psql` / `cargo`
incantations.

Install:

```sh
cargo install --path crates/boss-cli --bin boss
```

All commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output (designed
for Claude Code / scripted usage). Run `boss --help` or
`boss <subcommand> --help` for full flag listings.

## Operator commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `boss status [--json]` | Health check: all services, Postgres, NATS, backups |
| `boss restart <service> [--json]` | Restart a service without rebuilding |
| `boss logs <service> [-n 50] [-f] [--json]` | View service logs (journalctl) |
| `boss backup [--json]` | Trigger manual backup (pg_dump + configs) |
| `boss audit [--kind prefix] [--source svc] [--json]` | Query audit_log |

| `boss doctor install` | Post-install end-to-end health check |

The day-to-day operator playbook lives in

Break-glass procedures and disk-space recovery are documented
there.
