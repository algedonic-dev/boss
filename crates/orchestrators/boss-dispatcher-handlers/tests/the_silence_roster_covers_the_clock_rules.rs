//! The §9a pin on the silence roster's second source.
//!
//! `cadence.silence.sweep` watches two kinds of declared cadence:
//!
//! 1. **Timer-driven kinds**, declared as `interval_minutes.<kind>` args
//!    on the sweep's own rule row. That fact also lives in the systemd
//!    timer that executes the chore, so it is pinned by
//!    `infra/lint/timers-leave-a-packet.sh` — the bash check that fails
//!    CI when a rostered timer's kind is missing from the args, or when
//!    the two numbers disagree.
//! 2. **Clock-rule cadences**, DERIVED from the rule registry by
//!    `cadence_roster::clock_cadences`. Nothing is declared twice here,
//!    so there is nothing to pin in the §9a sense — the rule row is the
//!    single definition. What CAN go wrong is that a new rule drops out
//!    of the derivation silently: a computed `kind`, a guard shape the
//!    parser does not know, a schedule with no minute interval. That is
//!    the same "outside the roster by construction" defect one level up,
//!    and it is what this file refuses.
//!
//! The check lives HERE rather than in the bash lint deliberately. The
//! derivation is Rust; a bash re-implementation of "which rules declare
//! a cadence" would be a second definition of exactly the thing §9a
//! warns about, and it would drift the first time the parser learns a
//! new guard shape. So the preconditions are pinned where the
//! derivation lives, over the SHIPPED registry directory — which is the
//! registry's definition: `boss_dispatcher::rules::seed` publishes it
//! into the `dispatcher_rules` table at boot, and
//! `the_registry_equals_the_authored_directory_after_a_seed` proves the
//! two are the same set.
//!
//! Measured 2026-09-10 (backlog cf0f5e2d): eight clock-rule cadences
//! existed, all eight were outside the roster, and three families of
//! them had been silent for nine to nineteen days with nothing saying
//! so. The public mirror drifted 238 commits behind and a human noticed
//! by hand.
