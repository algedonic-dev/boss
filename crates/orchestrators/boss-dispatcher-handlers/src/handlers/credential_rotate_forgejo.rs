//! `credential.rotate.forgejo` — the credential broker's first
//! rotation handler (packet 7ee101aa, first leg).
//!
//! Rotates a Forgejo access token end-to-end as MACHINE steps of a
//! `rotate-a-credential` packet: mint a replacement via the issuer's
//! admin API, install it into the named k8s Secret its consumers
//! mount, verify by effect (the new token can read the repo it
//! exists for), revoke the old token, and record each phase as the
//! completion of the packet's own `issue` / `install` / `verify` /
//! `revoke` steps — so the audit trail IS the packet, with the rule
//! as actor. THE SECRET VALUE NEVER ENTERS A PACKET — OR AN EVENT:
//! every evidence field records an identifier (token name/id, secret
//! path, value length) or an observed effect, never the value.
//!
//! ## The four rotation events
//!
//! Each phase also lands a domain event at the moment it becomes
//! true — `credential.minted` / `.installed` / `.verified` /
//! `.revoked` — via the registry's rotation door
//! (`POST /api/credentials/{id}/rotation/{phase}`, the census-door
//! precedent: handlers own no database). The maiden rotation left NO
//! events; its provenance existed only as step metadata, findable by
//! archaeology rather than by kind, and a never-emitted kind is
//! invisible to the audit-integrity checker — only design review
//! caught it. The install phase is also what stamps the registry
//! row's `rotated_at`, in the door's own transaction.
//!
//! Emission is guarded so a redelivery after a FINISHED rotation
//! emits nothing (see Idempotence below): `minted` and `installed`
//! fire when the mint/install ran in THIS invocation; the converge
//! path re-emits only `installed` (marked `converged: true`) and only
//! while the packet's `install` step is still unrecorded — a death
//! before the mint event forces a re-mint (the Secret cannot match),
//! so a lost `minted` is structurally impossible. `verified` and
//! `revoked` are gated on their steps the same way. The one residue:
//! a run that died between recording an event and completing its step
//! may re-emit that phase on replay, marked as convergence — an
//! at-least-once trace, never a lost one.
//!
//! Fired by a rule on `step.done.credential-rotation` — a dedicated
//! StepType (the `gate-verdict` precedent) so the rule targets
//! exactly the scope step of a rotation packet and never fires on
//! an ordinary `task`. The rule row carries the credential's
//! consumer declaration as args (which Secret, which user, which
//! scopes, which repo proves it) — per-credential registry data,
//! not code.
//!
//! ## Idempotence (per rotation packet)
//!
//! JetStream is at-least-once, so the whole flow re-runs safely.
//! The minted token's name is derived from the packet id
//! (`rotation_token_name`), which makes the issuer the idempotence
//! ledger:
//!   - name absent            → mint fresh.
//!   - name present AND the installed Secret's last-eight matches
//!     that token → the rotation already happened; converge the
//!     remaining phases (verify / revoke / step evidence) only.
//!   - name present but the Secret does NOT match → a previous
//!     attempt minted and then died before installing; the value is
//!     unrecoverable (Forgejo returns the sha1 exactly once), so
//!     delete the orphan by its ledger id and mint again.
//!
//! Order is the protocol: issue, install, verify, THEN revoke — the
//! destructive call runs last and only after the new credential is
//! proven working, exactly as the workflow's own description demands.
//!
//! ## Off-host delivery, and the old token named by its last eight
//!
//! Design 1c90d183 (David, 2026-09-26) adds a credential whose consumer
//! is NOT a mount: the forge host's checkout token, which the host's
//! deposit (`infra/forge/credential-deposit.sh`) takes from the Secret on
//! its next converge pass. The rule declares that as `delivery =
//! "off-host"`, and then "proven working" is not enough to revoke: the
//! old value is still what every consumer on the host reads until the
//! deposit runs. So the scope firing stops after verify, and the host
//! completes the packet's `delivered` step (`credential-delivery`) with
//! the last eight of the value it installed; a second rule fires this
//! handler on that step, which re-plans (the Secret already holds this
//! packet's token — a delivery firing never mints), checks the host's
//! last eight against the Secret's, and only then revokes.
//!
//! The scoper may name the old token by `old_token_last_eight` — the
//! identifier the forge shows beside each token, computed on the host so
//! nobody has to hold the name or the value. It is resolved against the
//! issuer's ledger ONCE, and refused when it matches no token, several,
//! this rotation's own replacement, or a token the rule's `spare`
//! declares to another consumer — before anything is minted. The name it
//! resolved to is recorded on the packet (`old_token_resolved`), and
//! every later firing judges the old token by that name: absent from the
//! ledger is a token already revoked, so a retry after the DELETE lands
//! its event and its step, and a redelivered finished rotation is a
//! no-op (review F1 of car 85b7b55f — re-resolving on every firing made
//! the retry refuse a last eight that no longer matched anything).
//! That record is ordinary job metadata, so it is never trusted as
//! written: every firing judges it against the ledger at the resolve
//! point and again before the DELETE, and an absent name reads as
//! "already revoked" only while no live token but the replacement ends
//! in its eight (`judge_recorded`, review F1b of the re-review of
//! 5ef6db0b). Forging or deleting it can make a rotation refuse; it
//! cannot make one record a revoke of a token that is still live.
//!
//! Round 3 of that review (of 3ee1bb0c) found the three ways the judgement
//! could still be fooled, and each is now closed where it lived:
//!   - F1c: the ledger was one page of fifty. `list_tokens` now reads the
//!     forge's listing to an empty page and refuses a partial one, so every
//!     judgement — the resolve, the record's, the after-DELETE absence —
//!     reads the whole ledger.
//!   - F1d: the DELETE put a string from metadata into the URL path, where
//!     `../../../../repos/david/boss` reached the repository with the
//!     broker's admin root token — and on main the scope step's `old_token`
//!     did the same. The revoke now deletes a LIVE LEDGER ROW by its
//!     numeric id (`revoke_target`), and the issuer port takes nothing
//!     else; a reference no row answers to is simply absent.
//!   - F1e: a last eight shared by two live tokens named whichever the
//!     record said. It now names exactly one, or nothing is revoked by it.
//!
//! Round 4 (of c4cbc6b5, 2026-09-26) found that "simply absent" was
//! believed on the FIRST firing too: a mistyped `old_token` recorded a
//! revoke while the token the scoper meant stayed live (backlog 95dc0521).
//! Absence is now believed only on a firing that finds this packet's
//! replacement already installed — which only a firing that first found
//! the old token live can have done — and refused, named, before the mint
//! on every other. The same round pinned the after-DELETE absence check
//! and the listing's count to every page (796d8e64), and holds `forge_user`
//! to the forge's username grammar before it enters an admin URL
//! (cd2745b2).
