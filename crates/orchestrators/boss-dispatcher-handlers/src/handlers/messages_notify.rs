//! `messages.notify` — turn a step lifecycle event into an inbox
//! message ADDRESSED TO SOMEONE.
//!
//! This is the **push** side of the human-powered-state-machine
//! dispatcher. The **pull** side (the `/api/jobs/assignments` My Day
//! query) is what actually drives work; this handler adds awareness.
//!
//! Two events reach a person, and nothing else does:
//!
//! - a step becoming READY **with an assignee** — somebody put it in
//!   front of you, so it sends a `direct`;
//! - a step marked `notify_on_done` COMPLETING — the wait-is-over
//!   announcement, which still resolves a role to its on-call member
//!   and sends a `signal`.
//!
//! A ready step with only an `authority_role` sends NOTHING (David,
//! 2026-08-14: "we aren't ready for human on-call yet"). It is still
//! routed — it sits in the role's pull queue — but nobody is paged for
//! a duty that does not exist. A step with neither an assignee nor a
//! role was always a no-op.
