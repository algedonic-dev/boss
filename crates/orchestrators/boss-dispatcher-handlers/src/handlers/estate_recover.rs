//! `estate.recover` — the half of the estate alarm that closes.
//!
//! `estate.alarm` raises an urgent packet when a HARD finding persists
//! [`PERSIST_N`] consecutive comparisons of one series, deduped on
//! `metadata.estate_finding` — and until this handler nothing ever
//! closed it. The same series keeps arriving; when the finding is
//! ABSENT for [`PERSIST_N`] consecutive comparisons the condition has
//! recovered, the system of record holds the evidence, and the packet
//! still read as an open urgent alarm until a person noticed. Three
//! were closed by hand in two days (backlog ef421cd3: a1b4f3fa
//! boss-gcp-converge `unit_unhealthy`, e3da3202, fdd10ec8
//! boss-codebase-metrics `unit_unhealthy` — the last still open after
//! its fix landed 2026-09-14 15:55), each time the operator reading the
//! recovery off the record and typing it into the triage step. An
//! alarm only a human can clear trains the operator to leave alarms
//! open, and a stale open alarm suppresses the next real raise of the
//! same finding through the dedup.
//!
//! THE RULE IS THE RAISER'S RULE, MIRRORED. Recovery is judged over
//! the recorded comparison series exactly as persistence is
//! (`/api/estate/comparisons?scope=`, newest first, the same
//! `(scope, host)` series filter — the self-scoped host series
//! interleave, and host B's clean rows must not clear host A's alarm),
//! with the same N: N readings with the finding present is a
//! condition, N readings without it is the condition gone. Two things
//! the raiser does not need, this does:
//! - **the clean readings must postdate the raise.** `opened_at` on
//!   the packet (stamped by the jobs API at admission) is the floor;
//!   a row observed before it is not evidence the condition recovered
//!   AFTER it was raised. This is also what makes the silence sweep's
//!   `unobserved:<series>` alarms safe to judge by the same rule: a
//!   series that has gone dark has no new rows, so its newest N are
//!   the pre-silence ones and "the finding is absent there" would
//!   close the alarm the moment it was raised. N rows observed after
//!   the raise IS the series arriving again.
//! - **the N are consecutive.** The newest N same-series rows after
//!   the raise must ALL lack the key — a finding that flaps
//!   present/absent is still a condition, not a recovery.
//!
//! WHY A SIBLING HANDLER AND NOT A THIRD HALF OF `estate.alarm`.
//! The raiser reads the series only when the triggering comparison
//! found something hard, and reads packets only when it has something
//! to raise; recovery needs the opposite firing — the comparison that
//! found NOTHING — and needs the open packets first, to know whether
//! any alarm belongs to the series that just ticked. Folding that in
//! would have meant reordering the raiser's reads around a case it
//! never has, inside a module already carrying two calibrations.
//! A sibling on the same event has its own rule file (its own `why`,
//! its own retirement), its own redelivery budget (a failed close
//! never NAKs a raise), and reads the shared decisions from the
//! raiser (`hard_finding_keys`, `PERSIST_N`) rather than restating
//! them. Nothing in this module names a finding class: the raiser's
//! vocabulary is the recovery vocabulary.
//!
//! THE CLOSE IS THE TRIAGE STEP, completed with `disposition = stale`
//! — the backlog-item terminal titled "Closed — the claim no longer
//! holds", and what all three hand-closes chose — plus `evidence`
//! naming the finding, the host, and the N clean comparisons with
//! their instants. `recovered_at` rides both the step and the packet's
//! metadata (PATCH, merge) so the recovery can be read off the packet
//! without opening the step; the instant is the newest clean
//! comparison's own stamp — a fact of the record, the same on every
//! redelivery — not the moment the machine noticed. The step is
//! stamped [`CLEARED_BY`] so the raiser's settled-suppression can tell
//! a machine clear from a human's answer: a finding that recovers and
//! then persists again is a new fact and must re-raise, where a human's
//! `stale` holds for a week.
//!
//! Best-effort throughout, like the raiser: every alarm that could
//! close does; any write that failed is surfaced as one error at the
//! end so the firing is redelivered, where the judgement is idempotent
//! (a closed packet is no longer open, so it is not judged again).
