//! `jobs.complete_linked_step` — a closing Job completes the open step
//! it was authorized by, on the Job its declared edge names.
//!
//! The gap this closes: `ship-a-change` declares a `backlog_item` job
//! edge at the Job's metadata (migration 104, dialed to `abort` by
//! 105), pointing at the `user-feedback` packet the change answers.
//! Nothing read it. So a change could be scoped, built, gated,
//! reviewed, merged, deployed and observed working while the feedback
//! packet that asked for it sat at `submitted` — sixteen of them, on
//! 2026-08-11. The loop closed only when a person remembered.
//!
//! David ratified the rule this implements: "Once the user feedback
//! results in either a shipped change or some other terminal state, it
//! can be closed without the filer approving." So the system completes
//! the branch step triage opened, and the Workflow's own `ready_when`
//! does the rest — `closed` fires off `steps.investigate.done OR
//! steps.design-review.done OR steps.build.done OR
//! steps.needs-info.done`. Nothing here knows the feedback Job closes;
//! it completes a step, and the state machine draws the conclusion.
//!
//! ## Why this is a handler and not feedback-specific code
//!
//! Every noun is a rule arg. The handler knows "follow the edge named
//! by `link`, complete whichever of the steps named by `steps` is open
//! on the far end, stamp the evidence under `evidence_key`" — which is
//! a shape, not a policy. Which edge, which steps, and which Workflows
//! it applies to are the rule row's business (migration 117). Point it
//! at a different edge and it answers a different obligation.
//!
//! Rule shape:
//! ```toml
//! [[rule]]
//! on_event = "jobs.job.closed"
//! when = "kind = \"ship-a-change\" AND outcome = \"merged\""
//! [[rule.do]]
//! handler = "jobs.complete_linked_step"
//! args = { link = "\"backlog_item\"", steps = "\"investigate,design-review,build\"" }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Idempotence
//!
//! JetStream is at-least-once and the close marker is emitted from
//! three sites, so this WILL run more than once for one merge. Three
//! guards, cheapest first:
//!
//! 1. The linked Job is already closed → nothing open to complete.
//! 2. No step named by `steps` is `ready`/`active` → the branch was
//!    already completed (by us on the first delivery, or by a person).
//!    A completed step is never re-completed, so no second
//!    `step.done.*` marker fires and no second re-evaluation runs.
//! 3. The step already carries this car's id under `evidence_key` →
//!    belt to (2)'s braces, and the stamp that makes the write
//!    self-describing about which delivery wrote it.
