//! `jobs.complete_linked_step` — a closing Job completes the open step
//! it was authorized by, on the Job its declared edge names.
//!
//! The gap this closes: `ship-a-change` declares a `backlog_item` job
//! edge at the Job's metadata (migration 104, dialed to `abort` by
//! 105), pointing at the `user-feedback` packet the change answers.
//! Nothing read it. So a change could be scoped, built, gated,
//! reviewed, merged, deployed and observed working while the feedback
//! packet that asked for it sat at `submitted` — sixteen of them, on
//! 2026-08-11. The loop closed only when a person remembered.
//!
//! David ratified the rule this implements: "Once the user feedback
//! results in either a shipped change or some other terminal state, it
//! can be closed without the filer approving." So the system completes
//! the branch step triage opened, and the Workflow's own `ready_when`
//! does the rest — `closed` fires off `steps.investigate.done OR
//! steps.design-review.done OR steps.build.done OR
//! steps.needs-info.done`. Nothing here knows the feedback Job closes;
//! it completes a step, and the state machine draws the conclusion.
//!
//! ## Why this is a handler and not feedback-specific code
//!
//! Every noun is a rule arg. The handler knows "follow the edge named
//! by `link`, complete whichever of the steps named by `steps` is open
//! on the far end, stamp the evidence under `evidence_key`" — which is
//! a shape, not a policy. Which edge, which steps, and which Workflows
//! it applies to are the rule row's business (migration 117). Point it
//! at a different edge and it answers a different obligation.
//!
//! Rule shape:
//! ```toml
//! [[rule]]
//! on_event = "jobs.job.closed"
//! when = "kind = \"ship-a-change\" AND outcome = \"merged\""
//! [[rule.do]]
//! handler = "jobs.complete_linked_step"
//! args = { link = "\"backlog_item\"", steps = "\"investigate,design-review,build\"" }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Routing (v3, dda0713c)
//!
//! A car parked with `--park-backlog-item` names a `backlog-item`
//! whose triage nobody has done — the route asks an operator to
//! measure a claim, and a car that landed and was PROVEN (ship-a-
//! change's `merged` terminal is `ready_when = "steps.proven.done"`,
//! so this close is that moment) is the measurement. Five items were
//! closed by hand that way in one night. The optional `route` arg is
//! that routing as data: `{"kind", "step", "metadata"}` — the kind
//! whose triage vocabulary it speaks, the routing step, and what that
//! step requires at done. When none of `steps` is open and the
//! routing step is, the handler completes it, re-reads the packet,
//! and completes the branch the fork opened. Any other kind keeps the
//! v2 answer (a noop note): a filer's decision is theirs.
//!
//! ## One route per kind (v4, 1c704bb8)
//!
//! `route` is a LIST — a JSON array of the object above, one entry per
//! kind — and the single object is still accepted as a list of one. v3
//! named `backlog-item` alone and left `user-feedback` to its filer;
//! that held for feedback nobody had acted on, and inverted the moment
//! a car was PARKED AGAINST the packet: the build decision was made by
//! whoever linked the car, the landed and proven car is the evidence,
//! and David ratified exactly this close ("once the user feedback
//! results in a shipped change it can be closed without the filer
//! approving"). On 2026-09-14 his own feedback 9827c699 had its car
//! landed and proven inside seventy minutes and stayed open at triage
//! while the obligation wrote a noop on the car — closed by hand ten
//! minutes after the proof, the act this rule exists to remove. The
//! handler matches the packet's kind against the list; a kind no entry
//! names still keeps the v2 answer.
//!
//! ## Saying so on BOTH ends (ca76d8f9)
//!
//! When the obligation can act on neither the branch nor the route, the
//! note lands on the car AND on the item. It used to land only on the
//! car, so the ITEM — the side that still reads as unfinished work, and
//! the side whoever triages it next opens — carried no trace that a
//! change answering it had shipped. "A component that waited instead of
//! speaking" is the shape CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis names, and the item is
//! where that silence was paid for. The common case is fixed upstream
//! of this handler now: a park states the item's route when it files the
//! car (`boss_jobs::car::triage_on_park`), so what reaches here is the
//! residue that remains — an item a person routed somewhere this
//! obligation cannot act, or a kind whose triage is not its to make.
//!
//! ## Reading the answer (v5, 05d301be)
//!
//! A closing packet may carry the FACTS the step needs — an ops-request
//! whose verb read something back from a host — and until this version
//! the only substitutions were the car's own (`{branch}`, `{car}`,
//! `{title}`). The tag-release verb prints `tag-release: v1.2.3 at
//! <sha> (packet <id>)` as its last line, the release packet's `tag`
//! step requires exactly `tag` and `sha`, and "never a sha you did not
//! read from git" is that step's own procedure. Two optional args, in
//! `ops.judge`'s vocabulary so a rule author learns one:
//!
//! - `verb` — the closing packet's `metadata.verb` must equal it, or
//!   the close is not this rule's (every answered ops-request fires a
//!   `kind = "ops-request" AND outcome = "answered"` rule; the closed
//!   marker carries no metadata to select on).
//! - `verdict_pattern` — a regex with NAMED groups over the closing
//!   packet's `execute` step `output`; the LAST matching line is the
//!   answer, and each group substitutes `{name}` in `done_metadata`
//!   beside the car facts. No line matching means the verb did not
//!   answer (a refusal prints `REFUSED`, which no answer pattern
//!   matches): the obligation completes nothing and notes why on both
//!   ends, the way a dead link is noted. A pattern that is not a regex
//!   is rule authoring — `Permanent`, never retried.
//!
//! ## Reading the failure (v6, f47861a5)
//!
//! An ops-request closes `answered` when its verb RAN — the runner
//! records how it went as `exit_code` on the execute step, and nothing
//! in v5 read it. Measured 2026-09-19 on publish 254177e2: the
//! publish-github-pr verb printed `FAILED — … dubious ownership …`,
//! exited 1, and its request closed `answered`; v5 found no answer
//! line, noted the noop on both ends, and the publish's open-pr step
//! sat `ready` for five hours with nothing on it and no packet filed —
//! the yard drew a healthy publish. One optional arg:
//!
//! - `on_failure = "annotate-and-alert"` — when the closing packet's
//!   execute step records a non-zero exit, the step on the far end is
//!   NOT completed (it is not done) and NOT left alone: the verb's
//!   last FAILED line lands on it as `failed` (with `failed_exit`,
//!   `failed_source` = the request, and `alert`), and an URGENT
//!   backlog-item naming the verb, the request and the line is filed
//!   to the platform owner through the door every alarm handler uses.
//!   One alert per failed request (`for_request` dedups while open).
//!
//! ## The mode is the DEFAULT (v7, f47861a5)
//!
//! v6 shipped it opt-in, and opt-in covered the two rules whose author
//! had just watched the silence — and no other. The release rule
//! (`complete-release-tag-on-tag-release-answered`, landed the day
//! before) names no mode, so a `tag-release` that ran and FAILED
//! matched no answer line, wrote v5's dead-link note on both ends, and
//! left the release packet's `tag` step `ready` with nothing on it: the
//! measured shape of this packet on another verb, another protocol and
//! another step. A behaviour every rule author must remember to ask for
//! is the defect (CLAUDE.md §9a), and the default that makes a failure
//! loud is the one to make free. So `on_failure` is now an OPT-OUT: a
//! rule whose linked step is genuinely not troubled by its verb failing
//! writes `on_failure = "note"` and gets v5's answer; everything else,
//! including every rule written from here on, troubles the step it
//! would have completed. Only a closing packet with an `execute` step
//! recording a non-zero exit is a failure at all, so the rules that
//! react to a car, a gate-run or a design are untouched.
//!
//! ## Where the edge LIVES (v7, dd6d44b7)
//!
//! Every version above reads the link off the closing packet's JOB
//! metadata, which is where a car declares its `backlog_item` and
//! where `boss gate` stamps a gate-run's `agent_run`. One shape of
//! edge cannot live there: the one that names which agent-run is
//! executing a particular STEP. A packet hosts a run per step — the
//! page march dispatches `measure` and `file` on the same page-audit —
//! so a single job-level key could not say which, and an analyst run
//! (a measure, a draft, a judgement) ships no car and launches no
//! gate, so neither landing rule can ever fire for it. Until this
//! version every one of them needed a hand at the end, and roughly 94
//! were queued behind the page march.
//!
//! - `link_from = "step"` — read `link` off the COMPLETING STEP's
//!   metadata instead, which the `step.done.<kind>` payload already
//!   carries whole (`boss-jobs`'s step-done builder puts the step's
//!   `metadata` on the marker). `boss dispatch` writes the key there
//!   at the claim, so the step says which run is executing it — a
//!   fact, where the crew board's BUILDING lane used to infer one
//!   from a branch with no gate-run behind it. Default `"job"`: every
//!   rule authored before this names no `link_from` and is untouched.
//!
//! The edge is read BEFORE any request, because the rule that uses it
//! rides `step.done.*` — every completed step in the system — and only
//! a claimed one carries the key. Everything after that point is the
//! same handler: the same guards in the same order, the same evidence,
//! the same note on both ends. The evidence gains one field, the
//! completing `step`, for the same reason the edge cannot be
//! job-level.
//!
//! ## Idempotence
//!
//! JetStream is at-least-once and the close marker is emitted from
//! three sites, so this WILL run more than once for one merge. Three
//! guards, cheapest first:
//!
//! 1. The linked Job is already closed → nothing open to complete.
//! 2. No step named by `steps` is `ready`/`active` → the branch was
//!    already completed (by us on the first delivery, or by a person).
//!    A completed step is never re-completed, so no second
//!    `step.done.*` marker fires and no second re-evaluation runs.
//! 3. The step already carries this car's id under `evidence_key` →
//!    belt to (2)'s braces, and the stamp that makes the write
//!    self-describing about which delivery wrote it.
