//! `jobs.auto-park` — file a car when a gate-run goes GREEN carrying a
//! park intent, so a gate-green branch never strands unparked.
//!
//! THE ACTOR HALF OF AUTO-PARK. `boss gate --park-*` stamps the park
//! prose onto the gate-run (`park_*` metadata; the input half). When the
//! gate goes green the `record-verdict` step completes as
//! `gate-verdict`, and a rule on `step.done.gate-verdict` fires this
//! handler, which reads that intent + the verbatim receipt and files the
//! ship-a-change car — exactly what a human does with `boss park`, at
//! computer speed and while the base is still current (a stranded green
//! decays: gated yesterday, unmergeable today — 2026-09-01).
//!
//! FILES THROUGH `boss_jobs::car`, the shared builder `boss park` uses,
//! so the receipt-copy contract cannot drift (CLAUDE.md §9a). The receipt
//! is copied VERBATIM — never rebuilt — which is the bug `boss park` was
//! created to kill.
//!
//! A NO-OP, NOT AN ERROR, when this is not an auto-park: the verdict is
//! not green, or no `--park-*` intent was stamped (a plain manual gate).
//! The rule's `when` filters most of those, but the handler re-checks so
//! it is correct on its own terms.
