//! `jobs.run-car-probes` — a train arrived: run each boarded car's
//! recorded probe against production, by filing the ops-request the
//! forge host answers.
//!
//! THE ACTOR HALF OF CARRIED PROOF (backlog 28ac45ab). `boss gate
//! --park-probe/--park-expect` writes the probe at park time and the
//! auto-park handler copies it onto the car as `proof_probe` /
//! `proof_expect` (the input half, feat/the-car-carries-its-probe).
//! Until this rule, every recorded probe still waited for a person to
//! type `boss prove <car> --from-car`: 43 landed cars sat at
//! `proven: ready` for 2.5 days, and 12 were proven by hand in one
//! sitting. A pr-train closing `arrived` is the moment every car
//! aboard is merged AND converged, so it is the moment the probe
//! means something — and this handler files one `ops-request` per
//! probed car, `host=forge verb=run-car-probe args=[car]`.
//!
//! WHERE THE PROBE RUNS, AND WHY NOT HERE. The dispatcher's image does
//! carry a shell, so a shell-out from this handler would compile. It
//! is the wrong seat three times over: the dispatcher is the queue
//! watcher — clock, threshold, matchmaking, nothing else (David,
//! 2026-08-14) — and running a probe is an actor's work, not routing;
//! a probe that hangs would hold a JetStream consumer, and the
//! dispatcher owes the rest of the system its liveness; and the
//! vantage a probe needs (the converged checkout, the forge journal,
//! the SoR over the LAN) lives on the forge host, not in the `boss`
//! namespace. What the forge does NOT have is the cluster's vantage:
//! no kubectl, no kubeconfig. A probe is written on the dev pod and
//! run there, so it can be correct and unrunnable — measured on this
//! rule's first live run (f9304366), where both cars came back as an
//! exit code with empty streams. `boss gate` now refuses a probe
//! naming a tool in infra/forge/host-absent-tools.txt, and the runner
//! records `unrunnable` with the tool named rather than a bare exit
//! code. This rule does not restate every gate-side refusal; it applies
//! the ones nothing downstream can (the unidentified read, the offset
//! git date) — see [`ship_refusal`], which is where that call is argued
//! rather than described (23b2dffa, 71ec5a58).
//! The forge already answers
//! ops-request packets through a reviewed verb allowlist
//! (`infra/ops/verbs/run-car-probe.json`), so the run goes through that door:
//! `boss prove <car> --from-car --unattended` (the tree's CLI on the
//! forge, backlog 9f00a805) re-reads the car, refuses unless it
//! has merged and recorded a probe, runs the probe as `david` (never
//! root) with a timeout, judges it by the two rules `boss prove`
//! applies, and writes the verdict on the car — `proven` completed
//! with the recorded proof shape on green, `proof_attempt` on the car
//! and `proven` left ready otherwise.
//!
//! WHAT IT LEAVES ALONE. A car with no `proof_probe` — including an
//! EVENT-BOUND car that recorded `proof_event` instead — stays
//! hand-proven; a car already proven is not re-proven; a car that
//! already has an open run-car-probe request is not asked twice
//! (JetStream is at-least-once and the close marker is emitted from
//! three sites, so this WILL run more than once per arrival).
