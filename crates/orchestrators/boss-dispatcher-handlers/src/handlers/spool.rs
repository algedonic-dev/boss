//! The estate spool, Rust half — keep a reading the system of record
//! could not take, and replay it once the record can.
//!
//! WHY. CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: *an alarm that reports through its
//! subject dies with it*. The estate loop observes, compares and files
//! entirely through the jobs API, so during a system-of-record outage
//! it is silent about the outage — which is exactly when it is needed
//! (packet 6bf34846). The host observer's half of the answer already
//! exists and is pinned on every gate: `infra/estate/observe-lib.sh`
//! spools a reading the API refused and replays it, oldest first, when
//! the API answers again (packet ec50db46). This is the same mechanism
//! for the Rust stage that runs downstream of it.
//!
//! It is deliberately the SAME mechanism, not a new one: same spool
//! directory, same cap, same `SPOOL_DIR` / `SPOOL_MAX` knobs, same
//! oldest-first-and-stop-at-the-first-failure replay, same one-file-per
//! -reading-named-by-`observed_at` layout. An operator has one place to
//! look and one cap to reason about, and the two halves cannot disagree
//! about either: [`SPOOL_DIR_DEFAULT`] and [`SPOOL_MAX_DEFAULT`] are
//! DERIVED from the shell library by `build.rs` rather than restated
//! here (CLAUDE.md §9a — prefer collapsing).
//!
//! WHAT IS RETAINED IS THE INPUT, NOT THE OUTPUT. A stage spools the
//! reading it was handed, and replay re-runs the stage over it. That
//! matters because during an outage the stage's own *reads* fail too
//! (`estate.compare` cannot fetch the declared nodes it compares
//! against), so there is no output yet to keep. Re-running on replay
//! also lets the comparison be made against the registry as it is when
//! the record comes back, which is the only version that can be read.
//!
//! THE GAP STAYS VISIBLE. A replayed reading carries its ORIGINAL
//! `observed_at` — the stage stamps it from the reading, never from the
//! clock — so the series afterwards shows readings that arrived late,
//! not readings that never were.
//!
//! HONEST LIMIT, stated because it decides what this does and does not
//! buy. The spool is a directory on the process's own filesystem, and
//! the dispatcher shares a container with the jobs API
//! (`infra/oss-quickstart/services-launcher.sh`, one pod under
//! `Recreate`). So it covers the outage class where the record is
//! REACHABLE AND WRONG — 500s, a saturated database, a wedged jobs
//! process answering errors — which is the 2026-08-27 (25 minutes of
//! 500s) and 2026-09-02 shape. It does not survive the container
//! itself restarting; that class is already covered, because the
//! triggering event is unacked and JetStream redelivers it to the
//! fresh process (`boss-nats::durable`). What neither covers is an
//! outage longer than the redelivery budget — `MAX_DELIVER` 8 across a
//! ~98-second backoff — with the process alive, and that is the hole
//! this closes.
//!
//! An independent REPORT path — telling somebody about the outage over
//! a transport that does not run through the thing that is down — is
//! the packet's other half and is deliberately not built here.
