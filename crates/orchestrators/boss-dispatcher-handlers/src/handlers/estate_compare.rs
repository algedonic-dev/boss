//! `estate.compare` — declared vs observed; the difference is the finding.
//!
//! THE OTHER HALF OF THE ESTATE SPLIT (59ef456a). The `nodes` registry
//! says what machines we MEANT to have; `jobs.estate.observed` records
//! what a look at the cluster FOUND. Neither writes the other — if the
//! observer updated the registry, the cluster would become the source
//! of truth for its own declaration and nothing could ever be found
//! MISSING, only silently added. This handler is the comparison the
//! split exists for: it reads both sides over HTTP and records what
//! disagrees.
//!
//! EVENTED, NOT ON CADENCE — a deliberate divergence from the packet's
//! "handler on cadence" sketch, and strictly simpler: the rule fires on
//! `jobs.estate.observed`, so the observation arrives IN
//! `ctx.event_payload` and there is no `/api/events/tail` read, no
//! two-surface handler, and no second clock. The comparison inherits
//! the observation's own daily cadence; if the observer never fires,
//! the missing comparison datapoint is the signal, same as the census.
//!
//! SCOPE IS LOAD-BEARING. The observer's scope is `kubernetes-nodes`:
//! it can only see machines that joined the cluster. The registry also
//! declares machines the observer can NEVER see — the forge host and
//! boss-gcp — and counting those as "missing" would cry wolf on two
//! rows every single run. A declared row participates in this
//! comparison iff its role names a cluster node (`talos-*`) and it is
//! not retired. An observation carrying any OTHER scope is recorded
//! with its findings marked unknown-scope rather than guessed at.
//!
//! REPORT FIRST, RAISE LATER (the census's Q2 posture, unchanged): one
//! POST to `/api/estate/comparison` per observation, recording counts
//! and findings as a measured series. No packet is opened here — the
//! base rate is unknown, and a noisy raiser trains people to ignore
//! it. The raiser comes later, calibrated against this series.
//!
//! HONEST LIMITS:
//! - **Units are compared, never converted.** Both sides state memory
//!   and disk in GiB rounded to nearest — the one rule, stated once
//!   (migration 202608301905). A 1 GiB disagreement here is a real
//!   finding, not arithmetic.
//! - **Disk drift is informational.** Observed `disk_gb` is Kubernetes
//!   ephemeral-storage capacity, which is a filesystem's view, not the
//!   hardware's; it lands in `disk_informational`, not `drift`.
//! - **Disk HEADROOM is hard, on both scopes** (a520737f). Capacity
//!   drifting from the declaration is a paperwork question; a machine
//!   running out of room stops the pipeline, so one floor
//!   ([`disk_tight_finding`]) is applied to every observed machine
//!   whatever scope it arrived under. It could not fire for a cluster
//!   node until the observer started reading free space, and w-1 — the
//!   node every gate compiles on — was the one that mattered.
//!   `disk_unmeasured` is how a node that stops reporting free space
//!   stays distinguishable from one that has plenty.
//! - **A NotReady node is present, not absent.** It appears in
//!   `not_ready` and still counts as observed — a sick machine is
//!   there, and "missing" must keep meaning missing.
//! - **A failed read fails the firing.** No partial comparison is
//!   recorded; the schedule of the series makes the missing datapoint
//!   visible, and the runner logs the failure loudly.
//!
//! RETAINED WHEN THE RECORD CANNOT TAKE IT (packet 6bf34846). Both the
//! reads and the write above go to the jobs API, which is the thing
//! this stage is part of watching — CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis, *an alarm
//! that reports through its subject dies with it*. A failing firing
//! NAKs for redelivery, but that budget is 8 deliveries across a ~98
//! second backoff (`boss-nats::durable`), so an outage of any real
//! length dead-lettered the observation and the comparison was simply
//! never made — a hole in the series, and with it a hole in the
//! evidence `estate.alarm` reads back to decide whether a hard finding
//! has persisted.
//!
//! So a firing the record refuses now RETAINS the observation and
//! replays it on the next firing the record answers, oldest first
//! (`super::spool`, the Rust half of the mechanism the host observer
//! already has in `infra/estate/observe-lib.sh`). What is kept is the
//! OBSERVATION, not the comparison: during an outage the declared-nodes
//! read fails too, so there is no comparison yet to keep, and replay
//! re-runs this same code over it. The replayed comparison carries the
//! observation's ORIGINAL `observed_at`, so the series afterwards shows
//! readings that arrived late rather than readings that never were.
//!
//! `estate.alarm` needs no spool of its own, and that is a conclusion
//! from its code rather than an omission: it holds no state (`the SoR
//! is the state; the handler stays stateless`), re-derives every
//! finding from this series on each firing, and fires on every
//! comparison. Give it back the comparisons and its raise re-derives
//! itself; a raise it could not file during an outage is re-computed
//! and filed on the next comparison after it, deduped by
//! `estate_finding` the way a re-raise always is.
