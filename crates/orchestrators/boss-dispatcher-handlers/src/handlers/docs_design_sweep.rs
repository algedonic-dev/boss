//! `docs.design.sweep` — ask the level question on a clock.
//!
//! THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. `design-review-spawn` asks a LEVEL
//! question — "this doc has open questions and no open review" — but
//! only ever gets asked on an EDGE: `docs.design.indexed`, which by
//! design fires only when a doc's review surface changes. Close a
//! review while its questions are still open and the doc can never
//! get another one, because nothing about it will change again on its
//! own.
//!
//! That is not hypothetical. The 2026-08-13 audit closed five reviews
//! on the evidence "questions resolved; tracker pending_count=0;
//! decision history in doc" — and the evidence was wrong, because
//! `pending_count=0` also means nobody ever answered, and two of the
//! docs' Decision-history sections read `_None yet._`. Roughly
//! twenty-three questions across payload-encryption, queue-visibility,
//! workflow-ux-as-data, department-flow-dashboards and dev-cluster
//! became unreachable: not in anyone's queue, and with no mechanism
//! that could ever put them there. Confirmed directly — a reindex over
//! all 38 docs spawned ZERO reviews, because no doc's surface had
//! changed. They came back only because an agent went looking by hand
//! (ae8a14f7).
//!
//! WHY A SWEEP RATHER THAN A LOUDER EDGE. Making the reindex emit for
//! unchanged docs was considered and rejected: it turns every boot into
//! ~38 events, buys prompt spawning at the cost of a noisy log, and
//! STILL leaves the level unchecked between boots. The edge stays an
//! optimisation — spawn promptly on change — and this makes it stop
//! being the only path.
//!
//! WHY IT DELEGATES RATHER THAN SPAWNS. The obvious implementation
//! POSTs a Job itself, and then the shape of a design review lives in
//! two places: this file and the `design-review-spawn` rule row. So
//! instead the sweep decides only WHICH docs are orphaned and hands
//! each one to `jobs.spawn` as the payload the edge rule would have
//! delivered. The spawn spec stays where it belongs — in registry
//! rows an operator can read and edit — and this handler owns nothing
//! but the level question.
//!
//! THE WIDER CLASS, worth carrying: any dispatcher rule whose `when`
//! reads like a STATE rather than a TRANSITION has this latent.
//! Migration 107's own comment names `open_restock_exists` as the same
//! shape.
