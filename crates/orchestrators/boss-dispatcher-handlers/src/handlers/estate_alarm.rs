//! `estate.alarm` — the raiser the comparison series was recorded for.
//!
//! Post-mortem #2's blind spot, twice: on 2026-08-27 the cp-2/cp-3
//! kubelets flapped, boss served 500s for ~25 minutes, six CronJob
//! runs died — and it was found HOURS later, by hand, because every
//! noticing mechanism BOSS has keys off packets and a kubelet is not
//! a packet (a5adfb99). The estate loop already measures: observers
//! post, `estate.compare` records findings as a series on
//! `jobs.estate.compared` — "the series the eventual raiser will be
//! calibrated on (59ef456a, report first, raise later)". This is that
//! raiser: when a HARD finding persists across consecutive
//! comparisons, it becomes an urgent packet the overdue/watchlist
//! machinery can finally see. The algedonic channel BOSS is named
//! for, wired to the cluster itself.
//!
//! THE ALARM HEARS THE HOSTS (a7a19a1a, c6c0f3b1): the 2026-09-02
//! outage's chain 5 was components screaming for hours with nobody
//! interrupted — the host-scope series existed and the raiser ignored
//! them. Three additions closed that:
//! - `units_unhealthy` findings key (`host-units` scope): the quiet
//!   conductor — a unit active-but-functionless or dead where the
//!   observer derived unhealthy — persists like a NotReady node does.
//! - persistence is per SERIES, `(scope, host)`, not per scope: the
//!   self-scoped host series interleave (boss-gcp and the forge both
//!   post `host-units` every five minutes), and keyed by scope alone a
//!   clean row from one host erased the other's evidence, so a host
//!   finding could NEVER survive N consecutive rows. `estate.compare`
//!   stamps `host` on self-scoped comparisons for exactly this filter.
//! - the SILENCE SWEEP: an expected series that stops arriving IS a
//!   finding. A host observation older than [`STALE_MULTIPLIER`]x its
//!   own measured cadence means the observer died or the host did —
//!   either way the alarm's source went dark, and an alarm that only
//!   hears what its sources say dies with its patient. The sweep runs
//!   on EVERY firing (any surviving series triggers it), so one dead
//!   observer is noticed by its neighbors' heartbeats.
//!
//! CALIBRATION, so the alarm is worth trusting:
//! - HARD findings only — `not_ready` (a declared node that is sick),
//!   `declared_not_observed` (a declared node that is GONE),
//!   `disk_tight` (a host below the floor a gate needs), and
//!   `units_unhealthy` (a watched unit the observer derived sick).
//!   `observed_not_declared` is a paperwork gap and `drift` is config
//!   — real, but not 03:00-urgent, and an alarm that cries over
//!   paperwork trains operators to ignore it.
//! - PERSISTENCE over [`PERSIST_N`] consecutive same-series
//!   comparisons, read back from the recorded series (the SoR is the
//!   state; the handler stays stateless). One flapped reading is
//!   weather; N in a row is a condition. Staleness needs no separate
//!   persistence — [`STALE_MULTIPLIER`] missed cadences IS the
//!   persistence, already integrated over time.
//! - DEDUP against open packets carrying the same `estate_finding`
//!   key: a persisting condition is ONE packet, not one per firing.
//!
//! The raise is an URGENT packet on the operator's queue naming host +
//! condition + the latest evidence excerpt. Delivery beyond the queue
//! (push, phone) is deliberately NOT built here — that is channel
//! work for the harness, and the packet is the system-of-record raise
//! it would deliver.
//!
//! A no-op, not an error, when findings are absent, not yet
//! persistent, or already raised.
