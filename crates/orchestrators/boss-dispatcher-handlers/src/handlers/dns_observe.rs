//! `dns.observe` — the zone read the declaration was written for, and
//! the one apply it makes behind an interlock.
//!
//! THE DECLARED/OBSERVED SPLIT, APPLIED TO A DNS ZONE (design 4c565f8c,
//! backlog 5e58922c). `infra/cluster/dns/<zone>.toml` says what the
//! zone SHOULD hold; this handler reads what it DOES hold and records
//! the difference on a `dns-zone-observation` packet, one verdict per
//! record: MATCH, DRIFT (both values), ABSENT, UNDECLARED. It is the
//! same shape as `estate.compare` over the cluster's nodes, and for the
//! same reason: a zone nobody compares is a zone whose records are a
//! belief.
//!
//! ONE COMPARATOR. The zone comparison lives in the tree as
//! `infra/cluster/dns/check-declared.sh` — runnable by hand and in tests
//! with the records as INPUT and no credential. This handler is the
//! READER: it is the only place the broker's Cloudflare root token is
//! readable, so it fetches the zone, resolves the declaration's
//! references, and runs THAT script (`--json`) over what it fetched. A
//! Rust re-implementation here would be a second definition of the
//! comparison (CLAUDE.md §9a), free to disagree with the one an operator
//! runs on a laptop.
//!
//! A `tunnel:<credential id>` target is resolved from the system of
//! record, never a hardcoded uuid: the credential row's
//! `storage_location` names the k8s Secret, the Secret's credentials.json
//! names the TunnelID, and only that id crosses into the script's argv.
//! The tunnel secret never leaves the Secret store.
//!
//! WHAT STANDS IN FRONT (backlog 198c5fe9). `access.toml` beside the
//! zone file declares the Cloudflare Access applications the edge
//! consults before a request reaches the tunnel. This handler reads the
//! account's applications with the same root token, compares them in
//! the same vocabulary (the comparison is Rust, in this file — there is
//! no second definition of it anywhere, and its verdict gates a write,
//! which belongs where the token is), and APPLIES an ABSENT declared
//! application: creates it and its policies, idempotent by domain, then
//! READS THE ACCOUNT AGAIN so the packet records what is there, never
//! what was sent. DRIFT is reported and alarmed, never corrected.
//!
//! THE INTERLOCK. A zone record declaring `interlock = "access"` is
//! applied — created when ABSENT (replacing whatever other type the
//! name held), corrected when DRIFT — only once the application
//! declared for that name reads present with a policy whose decision is
//! `allow`, in the same firing. Otherwise the record stays as it is and
//! its verdict is rewritten HELD with `flip held — Access app absent`
//! (or `... has no allow policy`): reported on the packet, not counted
//! as a finding, because a held flip is a designed wait and not drift.
//! After an apply the zone is read and compared again, so the verdicts
//! on the packet are the zone AFTER the write; an apply that did not
//! take is then a plain ABSENT/DRIFT — a hard finding, alarmed.
//!
//! ORDER OF WRITES. On any hard finding (a zone DRIFT/ABSENT, or an
//! Access DRIFT/ABSENT) the estate alarm `dns_drift:<zone>` is filed —
//! or, when one is already open, REFRESHED with this reading (the
//! estate.alarm idiom: a persisting condition is one packet, never a
//! twin) — BEFORE the observe step is completed. A raise that fails
//! therefore NAKs the firing with the step still ready, and the
//! redelivery re-reads and retries; the opposite order would complete
//! the step, find it completed on redelivery, and lose the alarm.
//! UNDECLARED and HELD are recorded on the observation packet only —
//! the paperwork class, reported and not raised.
//!
//! REFUSALS ARE LOUD AND LEAVE THE PACKET OPEN. An unconfigured
//! declarations directory, a missing script or access.toml, an
//! unresolvable reference, a comparator refusal (exit 2) or an
//! unreadable zone or account each fails the firing with the cause in
//! the error; the dead letter lands on the `observe` step of a packet
//! that then LOOKS open, and the daily spawner files no twin while it
//! is.
