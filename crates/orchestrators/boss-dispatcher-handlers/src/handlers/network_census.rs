//! `network.census` — count what the network is carrying, on a clock.
//!
//! THE INVARIANT THIS MEASURES (packet-loss.md Q1, decided in review
//! `9fb9904f`): every admitted packet reaches a terminal, and every
//! non-terminal packet is visible at >= 1 station. The first half is
//! conservation over TIME, the second over SPACE — and the space half
//! became checkable the day stations became data, because "which
//! queues hold this packet" turned from a convention into a query. A
//! packet matching zero stations is orphaned by definition: nobody's
//! lens will ever show it, so no actor will ever work it.
//!
//! REPORT FIRST, RAISE LATER (Q2). This handler writes the measured
//! series and nothing else: no raiser, no threshold, no catch-all
//! orphan station. We do not yet know the base rate, and a noisy
//! raiser trains people to ignore it — the raiser comes later,
//! calibrated against the numbers this series accumulates. A cadence
//! rule firing daily (Q3) is what turns loss from a spot check into a
//! trend, the same move that turned train timings into the retro's
//! evidence. Destroyed-content detection is explicitly out of scope
//! (Q4) — named here so it is not mistaken for covered.
//!
//! WHAT ONE FIRING DOES. Everything is read through the jobs API — the
//! same public surface any caller gets, no private view:
//!
//! 1. Status totals: `GET /api/jobs?status=<s>&simulated=<b>&limit=1`
//!    per status per partition, reading `total` (a DB-side COUNT, not
//!    a page length). Simulated packets are counted SEPARATELY
//!    throughout — 87% of packets are the demo tenant's, and a
//!    headline number that mixes them measures the demo, not the
//!    company.
//! 2. The workable set: every open job, paged through
//!    `GET /api/jobs?status=open` (the list endpoint returns each
//!    job with its steps). A job with >= 1 ready/active step is
//!    WORKABLE — it is asking for an actor right now.
//! 3. Station coverage: `GET /api/stations`, then each station's
//!    `GET /api/stations/{name}/queue`, unioning member job ids. A
//!    workable job in no queue is ORPHANED — Q1's space half, the
//!    checkable one.
//! 4. One POST to `/api/network/census`, which records the counts as
//!    a single `jobs.network.census` event on the audit log.
//!
//! THE TIME HALF is measured as `closed_on_census_day`: the count of
//! packets that reached a terminal (closed or cancelled) today, by
//! the authoritative clock. The list endpoint has no direct
//! closed-on-day filter, but `closed_within=0` returns exactly
//! "non-terminal OR reached a terminal today" as a DB-side total, so
//! `closed_on_census_day = total(closed_within=0) - sum(non-terminal
//! status totals)` — arithmetic over exact counts, no scan. Clamped
//! at zero because the reads are not one transaction (see LIMITS).
//!
//! HONEST LIMITS, stated rather than implied:
//!
//! - **Read skew.** The census is assembled from many API reads, not
//!   one snapshot; packets that move between reads can shift a count
//!   by a few. Acceptable for a daily trend, and stated here so
//!   nobody mistakes single-digit jitter for loss.
//! - **Station pages clip at the server's MAX_LIMIT (1000).** A
//!   station's queue is evaluated over at most 1000 candidate
//!   packets; with more open packets than that, a true member can be
//!   missed and read as orphaned. `station_page_clipped: true` in
//!   the payload flags exactly this condition (open total across
//!   both partitions > 1000), so a reader can tell a measured zero
//!   from a maybe-clipped one.
//! - **Per-actor stations are not globally evaluable.** A station
//!   whose predicate carries the `@me` placeholder binds to whoever
//!   asks; the census (asking as the dispatcher rule) would only see
//!   its own empty view, so those stations are skipped and counted
//!   in `per_actor_stations_unevaluated`. A packet whose ONLY
//!   visibility is somebody's personal station therefore counts as
//!   orphaned here; `orphaned_with_assignee` (orphans that carry an
//!   assignee on a workable step, and so at least appear in that
//!   person's assignment pull) is reported so the raiser can be
//!   calibrated with that class in view.
//! - **A failed read fails the firing.** Any error aborts the census
//!   with no event: a partial count landing in the series would
//!   poison the trend it exists to build, and the schedule runner
//!   logs the failure loudly. The missing datapoint IS the signal.
