//! prove a handler REFUSES a body with no `data` array (backlog
//! 37fc5837) rather than reading it as an empty list.
//!
//! One definition rather than a copy per handler: seven sites in five
//! handlers take the same test, and each needs only "answer these
//! paths with these bodies, and tell me whether anything was written".
//! The judgement itself lives in `common::rows_or_refuse`; this only
//! lets a test drive the handler to it end to end, so the test fails
//! on the READ SITE and not on the helper.
//!
//! Test-only: declared `#[cfg(test)]` in `handlers/mod.rs`.
