//! `sensor.poll` — the first sensor: a declared poll of the world
//! outside BOSS, recorded outside the audit log, opened as work.
//!
//! Design 14c9b2ad (decided with David 2026-09-17: "Polling is fine,
//! use a restricted read-only key"), backlog 2d33e111. ONE platform
//! cadence rule (`sensors-poll-every-5-minutes`) fires this handler; it
//! reads the sensor registry (`GET /api/sensors`) and, for every
//! enabled sensor whose `every_minutes` has elapsed since its last
//! attempt (`SensorRow::due_at` — never true of a push-only source
//! such as `site`, whose readings the gateway records itself,
//! 0b5c5081), asks the source adapter for everything since the sensor's
//! cursor, records the readings (insert-if-absent), opens ONE packet
//! per reading that still owes one, stamps it, and marks the poll.
//! The product knows how to read a source; WHAT to open for it is the
//! sensor row — tenant data.
//!
//! THE READING IS NOT THE FACT; THE PACKET IS. David, 2026-09-16: "the
//! audit_log just needs to capture all work that is done; sensors
//! record data that don't flow into the audit_log." Nothing here
//! writes the log directly. The packet the poll opens — signed
//! `automation:sensor:<id>`, subject `<subject_kind>/<external id>` —
//! is the audit-log fact, and the reading is the evidence it was opened
//! from.
//!
//! IDEMPOTENT BY EXTERNAL ID. The source is read from the cursor
//! INCLUSIVE (a charge created in the cursor's own second must not be
//! lost), so a redelivery re-reads what it read before; the readings
//! door inserts nothing twice, and a reading is opened only while its
//! `packet_id` is null and stamped before the next one is opened. So a
//! firing that died between opening and stamping opens that ONE
//! packet again on the next pass — the honest bound; a firing that
//! died anywhere else opens nothing twice. Pinned by the test that
//! runs the handler twice and counts one packet.
//!
//! FAILURE IS LOUD ON A PACKET. A sensor has no packet of its own to
//! dead-letter on, so an UNREADABLE credential — the env var unset, a
//! 401/403 from the source, a source the product has no adapter for —
//! files the estate-style alarm `sensor_unreadable:<id>` (an urgent
//! backlog-item deduped by `estate_finding`, REFRESHED only when the
//! reason changes, so a persisting condition is one packet and not a
//! metadata write every five minutes) and marks the poll so the next
//! attempt waits the sensor's own period. The next GOOD read closes it
//! through its triage step (`disposition = stale`, the estate.recover
//! idiom). A network blip is a `Downstream` error: the firing NAKs, the
//! poll is NOT marked, and the next tick retries.
//!
//! AN UNOPENABLE PACKET IS THE SAME SHAPE, ONE STEP LATER (backlog
//! f50a9ec1, 2026-09-17). A source that reads fine can still declare a
//! packet the jobs API refuses — the `opens_kind` not published, its
//! `subject_kind` unknown to the registry, the described metadata
//! failing the kind's schema. Until this car that refusal was only
//! logged: a 400 rode the transient lane and retried every tick, a 422
//! terminated the whole firing, and nothing on any packet said why the
//! reading sat unstamped. Now a refusal (a 4xx that is not a miss, a
//! conflict or a throttle — `is_refusal`) files `sensor_unopenable:<id>`
//! through the SAME raise / refresh / recover mechanics as the
//! unreadable alarm, carrying the API's answer verbatim (status + body,
//! bounded by `REFUSAL_BOUND`) and the reading's id. The reading stays
//! unstamped, so it is still owed; the poll is marked so the next
//! attempt waits the period; and the first open that succeeds closes
//! the alarm. The two are two findings on one sensor, each recovered by
//! its own later success: a source that reads again closes the
//! unreadable one on the read even while its packets are still refused.
//!
//! THE VALUE IS NEVER READ EXCEPT TO SEND IT. The handler holds the
//! credential values the deployment handed it by registry id
//! (`BOSS_BROKER_STRIPE_KEY` for `stripe-restricted-read`, the same
//! optional-secretKeyRef idiom as the Cloudflare root) and passes one
//! to the adapter as a bearer. It is never logged, never on a packet,
//! never in an error string.
