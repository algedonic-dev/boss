//! `boss-sim` — shape-driven simulation primitives.
//!
//! The crate ships the alphabet that every per-tenant engine
//! (`boss-brewery-engine`, `boss-used-device-shop-engine`)
//! composes: the day-loop runner + Periodic / Counterparty engines
//! (`engines`), the Workflow/Step/Subject day-loop body
//! (`shape_driven`), the SimOutput trait and its in-memory + live
//! HTTP adapters (`output`), the seeded PRNG (`rng`), the calendar
//! registry (`calendar`), and the cross-tenant sales-tax-rate table
//! (`tax_rates`).
//!
//! A tenant is described as data: a `tenant.toml`, a
//! `workflows.toml`, and a per-tenant engine crate.

/// Actor-coverage telemetry — is the sim driving the WHOLE roster?
/// Pure computation of per-role roster vs acting vs completions,
/// rendered by the simulator SPA so an under-simulated tenant is
/// visible on its face.

/// Per-actor API-call tallies — the cockpit's "how the sim engages the
/// API, by who's acting" telemetry. Shared between the workforce + the
