//! `simulate_day` — the day-loop primitive for the shape-driven
//! sim. Composes tenant config + JobKind registry + StepRegistry +

//!
//! Stages 2 + 3: Job creation, eager Step materialization at
//! Job-open time, daily Step advancement (Ready → Completed with
//! metadata filled by the faker), and Job closure when every Step is
//! terminal. The sim is a JobKind-v2 executor client: it posts

//! Stages 4 + 5 (Subject birth + anomaly injection +
