//! [`prepare_model`] — the brewery's single tenant-prepare entry
//! point. Against a running BOSS stack — each service on its own port
//! by default, or all behind one gateway URL — it seeds the entire
//! brewery tenant model through the public API, in dependency order:
//!
//! 1. classes — POST /api/classes/batch (the taxonomy that employee +
//!    account writes validate against, so it lands first).
//! 2. policy — tenant role grants ([`boss_policy::bootstrap`]); these are
//!    capability-level (`resource = "job-kind"`, not a specific kind), so
//!    they need no published JobKinds, and the design-Job approval in
//!    step 4 needs the `job-kind-approver` grant resolved first.
//! 3. data — operators, employees, accounts, vendors, messages,
//!    finished-goods, raw materials, equipment, assets, and opening
//!    balances ([`super::seed_tenant_data`]).
//! 4. JobKinds LAST ([`super::publish_job_kinds`]) — each one opens a real
//!    `job-kind-design` Job with role-bearing `approve` + `publish` steps
//!    that the dispatcher auto-assigns the moment they go ready. Their
//!    holders (the `job-kind-approver`-granted leaders, it-director,
//!    platform-admin) must already be seeded AND queryable, or the
//!    assignment dead-letters against a cold roster — so we barrier on the
//!    people projection before opening them.
//!
//! This collapses what reset-to-baseline / seed-brewery-tenant.sh
//! drove as four scattered binary + curl steps into one library call,
//! so the offline regen, the live demo, and CI all run identical code.
//!
//! Two adjacent concerns stay with the caller by design:
//!
//! - **Clock loop-bounds.** [`super::seed_tenant_data`] rebases the
//!   clock to the sim epoch internally (the pre-sim provisioning
//!   window) so seed writes stamp at day 0; the epoch_end + warp_factor
//!   that bound the sim's run are set by whoever drives the clock
//!   (reset-to-baseline / the sim daemon), not here.
//! - **Platform baseline.** The platform operator-baseline
//!   (`bootstrap-admin`, minted from a deploy credentials file) and
//!   the projection rebuilds are platform-init / read-model concerns —
//!   not tenant data, and not API-orchestratable — so they remain in
//!   the deploy/reset orchestration.
