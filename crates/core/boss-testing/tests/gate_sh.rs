//! The rust gate has ONE definition: `infra/gate.sh`.
//!
//! On the 2026-08-10 train (PR #226) the gate's definition lived twice —
//! once in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, once in whatever the agent ran
//! locally before pushing a car — and drifted twice in one day: a car
//! gated with named test files missed a lib-suite pin, and a car gated
//! with full crate suites missed a shell lint only CI ran. CLAUDE.md
//! §9a: collapse the pair, and pin what cannot collapse.
//!
//! The collapse: ci.yml's rust job invokes `infra/gate.sh` instead of
//! inlining cargo commands and lint scripts, so CI and a local run are
//! the same definition. What cannot collapse is pinned here:
//! - ci.yml must actually call the script, and must not grow a second
//!   inline definition beside it (a new `run: infra/lint/...` line in
//!   the rust job is the pair reopening);
//! - the script must keep covering the checks the gate exists to run —
//!   a trimmed roster is exactly the under-covering gate that let both
//!   #226 failures through.
//!
//! Both tests name the offending entry when they fail.
