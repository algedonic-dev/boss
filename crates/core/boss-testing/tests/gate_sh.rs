//! The rust gate has ONE definition: `infra/gate.sh`.
//!
//! On the 2026-08-10 train (PR #226) the gate's definition lived twice —
//! once in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, once in whatever the agent ran
//! locally before pushing a car — and drifted twice in one day: a car
//! gated with named test files missed a lib-suite pin, and a car gated
//! with full crate suites missed a shell lint only CI ran. CLAUDE.md
//! §9a: collapse the pair, and pin what cannot collapse.
//!
//! The collapse: the CI workflow's test job invokes `infra/gate.sh`
//! instead of inlining cargo commands and lint scripts, so CI and a
//! local run are the same definition. What cannot collapse is pinned
//! here:
//! - the workflow must actually call the script, and must not grow a
//!   second inline definition beside it (a new `run: infra/lint/...`
//!   line in the test job is the pair reopening);
//! - the script must keep covering the checks the gate exists to run —
//!   a trimmed roster is exactly the under-covering gate that let both
//!   #226 failures through.
//!
//! There is ONE CI workflow now: `.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml`. The GitHub
//! copy (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) ran only on the public mirror —
//! which is a backup of source, not part of CI/CD (design 7b59af2c,
//! 2026-09-08) — and was deleted with it, so the pair it once formed
//! with the forge file is gone rather than pinned.
//!
//! Every test names the offending entry when it fails.

/// gate runs as uid 65534 and every builder brief says to verify work
/// under `setpriv --reuid=65534`. The dev pod's checkout is root-owned
/// (`drwxrwsr-x root 1500`), so since git 2.35.2 every git command run
/// by any other uid refuses it:
///
///     fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/work/boss'
///
/// `--auto` derives its scope from git, so the refusal became "found no
/// change at all against HEAD~1" and the gate declined before the poll
/// this file tests could happen: 12 of 13 as 65534, 13 of 13 as root.
/// A test ABOUT the gate that cannot pass the verification step the
/// gate itself demands leaves a builder choosing between ignoring a red
/// and stopping, which is the whole packet.
///
/// The fix is git's own env-var config channel, and it reaches every
/// git in the child tree rather than only gate.sh's own calls —
/// measured as 65534 in this tree: `--roster` and `--self-test` make 3
/// git calls each (trunk-candidate `rev-parse`, discarded in those
/// modes), `--quick` makes 223 of which 34 hit the refusal, and without
/// this env `--quick` exits 1 naming three pre-flight lints that read
/// history — `migrations-append-only`, `no-secrets`,
/// `steptype-bundle-ratchet` — while the receipt's `rev-parse HEAD`
/// degrades to `"head": "unknown"`. With the env supplied, the same
/// `--quick` as 65534 exits 0 and no ownership refusal is left.
///
