//! The rust gate has ONE definition: `infra/gate.sh`.
//!
//! On the 2026-08-10 train (PR #226) the gate's definition lived twice —
//! once in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, once in whatever the agent ran
//! locally before pushing a car — and drifted twice in one day: a car
//! gated with named test files missed a lib-suite pin, and a car gated
//! with full crate suites missed a shell lint only CI ran. CLAUDE.md
//! §9a: collapse the pair, and pin what cannot collapse.
//!
//! The collapse: the gate runner (`infra/gate-runner/run.sh`) invokes
//! `infra/gate.sh` for every car and — since 2026-09-13, design 128b5496
//! — for every train, so a gate and a local run are the same definition.
//! The CI workflow's `test` job used to be the train's copy of it; that
//! job is gone. What cannot collapse is pinned here:
//! - the runner must actually call the script, and the workflow must
//!   not grow a second inline definition (a `test` job or a
//!   `run: infra/lint/...` line is the pair reopening);
//! - the script must keep covering the checks the gate exists to run —
//!   a trimmed roster is exactly the under-covering gate that let both
//!   #226 failures through.
//!
//! There is ONE CI workflow now: `.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml`. The GitHub
//! copy (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) ran only on the public mirror —
//! which is a backup of source, not part of CI/CD (design 7b59af2c,
//! 2026-09-08) — and was deleted with it, so the pair it once formed
//! with the forge file is gone rather than pinned.
//!
//! Every test names the offending entry when it fails.

/// gate runs as uid 65534 and every builder brief says to verify work
/// under `setpriv --reuid=65534`. The dev pod's checkout is root-owned
/// (`drwxrwsr-x root 1500`), so since git 2.35.2 every git command run
/// by any other uid refuses it:
///
///     fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/work/boss'
///
/// `--auto` derives its scope from git, so the refusal became "found no
/// change at all against HEAD~1" and the gate declined before the poll
/// this file tests could happen: 12 of 13 as 65534, 13 of 13 as root.
/// A test ABOUT the gate that cannot pass the verification step the
/// gate itself demands leaves a builder choosing between ignoring a red
/// and stopping, which is the whole packet.
///
/// The fix is git's own env-var config channel, and it reaches every
/// git in the child tree rather than only gate.sh's own calls —
/// measured as 65534 in this tree: `--roster` and `--self-test` make 3
/// git calls each (trunk-candidate `rev-parse`, discarded in those
/// modes), `--quick` makes 223 of which 34 hit the refusal, and without
/// this env `--quick` exits 1 naming three pre-flight lints that read
/// history — `migrations-append-only`, `no-secrets`,
/// `steptype-bundle-ratchet` — while the receipt's `rev-parse HEAD`
/// degrades to `"head": "unknown"`. With the env supplied, the same
/// `--quick` as 65534 exits 0 and no ownership refusal is left.
///
/// SCOPED TO THE RESOLVED `repo_root()`, never `*`: blessing one known
/// path is a statement about this checkout, while a wildcard would bless
/// every repository a test ever reaches — including the throwaway clones

/// credential helper: a flat `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1` here would silently
/// take that helper away from the child.
///
/// WHY `safe.directory` IS RIGHT HERE AND WRONG IN
/// `infra/forge/delete-orphan-object.sh`, which rejected it by name and
/// drops to the tree's owner instead: that verb runs as root inside
/// somebody else's clone, and a root WRITE there leaves root-owned

/// check would buy its read at the price of making that hazard reachable
/// by the next edit. Nothing in this direction writes: `--auto` diffs,
