//! The LAN machine door carries every read surface, and the probe
//! reader routes to it by path (design `28d2bed9`, David 2026-09-17).
//!
//! WHAT WAS MEASURED. `boss-jobs-internal` (10.20.0.34, MetalLB,
//! LAN-only) exposed ONE port — the jobs API — and `boss-sor-read`, the
//! one way a car's recorded probe reads the system of record, was
//! `curl $BOSS_JOBS_URL$path`. So two landed cars on 2026-09-17 could
//! not be proven: the locations door (1ec8312a, proved by tree shape
//! instead) and the batch-door events (056f7bd8, UNPROVEN — its probe
//! reads `/api/events/tail`, which lives on boss-events-api and
//! answered 404 on the jobs port). Every future car about people,
//! classes, locations or the audit tail had the same blindness: "no
//! evidence is not a pass", and the instrument could not collect the
//! evidence.
//!
//! THE FACT THAT LIVES THREE TIMES (CLAUDE.md §9a). Which services the
//! door carries, on which port, is written in three places that no
//! build step connects:
//!
//!   1. the Service manifest, `infra/cluster/manifests/boss-jobs-internal.yaml`
//!      — what the cluster actually exposes on 10.20.0.34;
//!   2. `infra/forge/sor-ports.env` — the `name=port` table the forge's
//!      `boss prove --unattended` hands the reader as `BOSS_SOR_PORTS` (read
//!      as data from the converged checkout: the forge
//!      has no cargo and no boss-ports binary, so the table is checked
//!      in rather than rendered there);
//!   3. the path-prefix → service table in
//!      `infra/forge/probe-bin/sor-routes.sh` — which services a path
//!      can be routed to at all. Until backlog de0989d2 (2026-09-17)
//!      that table sat inside `boss-sor-read` itself; it moved into a
//!      sourced file so the pod's door (`infra/dev/boss-api`) routes by
//!      the SAME rules without a second copy (CLAUDE.md §9a). Both
//!      scripts source it, and this test reads it from the one place.
//!
//! The DEFINITION of a port is `boss-ports`. This test reads all three
//! copies and holds each equal to the roster: every service the route
//! table names is a boss-ports service, the manifest exposes exactly
//! those services on their prod ports under their boss-ports names, and
//! the env table says the same. One test, three readers; a drift in any
//! copy names the entry.
//!
//! WHY ACCOUNTS IS ON THE DOOR (backlog de0989d2, measured 2026-09-17
//! 14:50Z). The first real sponsorship's reconcile step needs an account
//! created through `POST /api/people/accounts`, which boss-accounts
//! serves on 7550 — and no machine door reached it: the LAN door carried
//! jobs/events/people/classes/locations and the pod's door had no
//! routing at all, so the agent could not do the first real step of the
//! first real loop through any door. Same trust class as design
//! 28d2bed9: the jobs API's writes are already on this IP.
