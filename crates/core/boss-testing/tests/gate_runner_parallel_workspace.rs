//! Parallel gates are safe because the workspace is per-run — pin it.
//!
//! THE INCIDENT CLASS (packet 28de3845). Gates were strictly serial:
//! the runner Job mounted one shared RWO PVC as /gate-target, run.sh
//! wiped it per run, and `boss gate` refused a second launch. Nothing
//! but that refusal (and scheduling luck) stood between two concurrent
//! gates and 2026-08-24's crossed receipts — a receipt naming one
//! branch's head reported under another, all three results discarded.
//! On 2026-09-02 nine cars serialized through the one runner at ~14
//! minutes each; gating was the pipeline's bottleneck.
//!
//! The shape that ends it: /gate-target becomes a per-run emptyDir
//! (born with the pod, dies with it — isolation is structural, not
//! guarded), and the PVC survives only as the WARM SEED: a snapshot of
//! a target/ built at main's tip, copied into each run's workspace,
//! plus the crate cache. Every property that makes that safe and fast
//! is pinned here, because each one decays into a real, named incident
//! if it drifts:
//!
//! - workspace on a PVC again: crossed receipts (2026-08-24)
//! - seed mount gone: every gate cold, ~74G / 20+ min of rebuild
//!   (measured, boss-dev.yaml)
//! - crate cache per-run: verdicts bet on static.crates.io; a green
//!   branch was called red by the network on 2026-08-27
//! - unbounded workspace disk: "No space left on device" turned into
//!   fake code failures (2026-08-23)
//! - unlocked seed read/refresh: a torn seed — half-copied rlibs under
//!   fresh fingerprints, reds that are nobody's code
