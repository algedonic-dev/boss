//! `infra/forge/run-car-probe.sh` runs a car's recorded probe on the
//! FORGE HOST. The probe was written on the dev pod, which is a
//! different machine with different tools — so a probe can be correct
//! and unrunnable, and this test pins the mechanism that tells those
//! two apart.
//!
//! THE DEFECT (backlog f9304366, measured 2026-09-09). The auto-proof
//! loop's first live run: a train arrived, the rule filed one
//! ops-request per probed car, the forge's ops-runner answered both,
//! and NEITHER car proved. Both probes were
//! `kubectl -n boss-dev exec deploy/boss-conductor -- …`, which is
//! right from the pod and impossible from the forge (outside the
//! cluster, no kubeconfig). The recorded evidence was
//! `{"exit": 1, "output": ""}` — an exit code with empty streams, which
//! reads exactly like a false claim.
//!
//! The reason the streams were empty is the whole lesson: the probes
//! swallowed their own diagnostics. `kubectl … 2>&1 | grep -q …` sends
//! the shell's own `kubectl: command not found` INTO the pipe, where
//! grep eats it. Nothing run-car-probe.sh does with stderr can recover
//! a message the probe redirected away from it.
//!
//! So the script hands the probe's shell a `command_not_found_handle`
//! and a file descriptor the probe's redirections cannot reach (fd 9,
//! opened before the probe's own text runs). Every command bash could
//! not find is recorded there, and the attempt says `unrunnable` with
//! the tool named — CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis, a verdict must name what
//! failed.
//!
//! This test RUNS that prelude, extracted verbatim from the script, so
//! the mechanism cannot rot into a comment. It needs bash and nothing
//! else — the script's own jq/curl path is covered by the record-shape
//! pin in boss-cli's prove.rs.
//!
//! The second half of the file covers the OTHER way a probe can be
//! correct and worthless: reading the system of record unidentified, so
//! an absence assertion passes against a page it was never allowed to
//! see (61085a9e). Both are the same family — a probe whose evidence
//! cannot be told apart from a false claim.

// A PROBE READS THE SYSTEM OF RECORD AS A NAMED READER (61085a9e).

// THE DEFECT, measured 2026-09-10 against one backend at one commit.
// The script builds the right `x-boss-user` header for its OWN three
// calls — read the car, write the verdict, patch the attempt — and
// hands the probe an env carrying only `BOSS_JOBS_URL`. So a probe
// doing `curl $BOSS_JOBS_URL/api/...` reads as `operator:unidentified`,
// and policy answers a NARROWER WORLD without saying so:
//
//   /api/jobs?kind=pr-train&status=open        operator 1  → 0
//   /api/jobs?kind=ship-a-change&status=open           21  → 0
//   /api/jobs?kind=backlog-item&status=open            30  → 0
//   /api/yard/status  trains/dock/recent/dock_depth 1/1/8/1 → all 0
//   /api/workflows                                     84  → 84 (same)
//
// Per-surface, with nothing in the answer to say which kind you hit.
// `/api/yard/status` comes back a confident, well-formed, completely
// idle yard: no trains, nothing on the dock, threshold not met.
//
// WHY THAT IS WORSE THAN A BROKEN READ. A PRESENCE assertion fails for
// the wrong reason and reads as a false negative about the car —
// recoverable, because someone investigates. An ABSENCE assertion
// PASSES FALSELY: "no open job of kind X remains" is green against an
// empty page the probe was never allowed to see. That is a proof that
// vouches for nothing, recorded as a proof, on a car that then closes.
// It caught the person who filed the item twice in one hour.
//
// THE FIX, and why it is not one line. Exporting the script's own
// `BOSS_USER` would hand every car's probe text a platform-admin
// credential with WRITE capability, and a probe is program text
// authored upstream and run as david on the forge. So the probe gets a
// SEPARATE, READ-SCOPED actor (`audit-readonly`: core policy grants it
// Read at Scope::All on every shipped resource and no other action at
// all) plus a GET-only reader on its PATH whose header comes from the
// runner, never from the probe's text.
