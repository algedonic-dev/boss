//! A failed gate must be explainable from the RECEIPT, and from
//! `kubectl logs` when the receipt is not enough.
//!
//! THE FAILURE THIS PINS. `gate.log` is written to `/gate-target`, a
//! volume only the gate container mounts. When that container exits the
//! last reader of the file is gone, so a red verdict left a receipt
//! naming WHICH check failed and no way at all to learn WHY. Three
//! branches were called red by the gate-runner and then passed those
//! same checks run by hand; no theory could be tested, because the
//! evidence was destroyed with the pod every time (backlog 9c7ed804).
//!
//! THE SECOND FAILURE, one level deeper (backlog 4a4d1227). Gate-run
//! 9dc722d2 recorded `verdict: failed` with a 62-entry `checks` array
//! correctly naming `test` as the single failure — and nothing at all
//! about WHICH test. The name was one grep away in the pod log, and the
//! pod log is reaped; the receipt is the durable record. So the same
//! extractor that replays the failed sections to stdout now also writes
//! the part a reader ACTS on — the failing test names and the panic line
//! with its `file:line` — into the receipt's `fails`, bounded, with
//! every reduction stated.
//!
//! ONE PARSER, TWO OUTPUTS. The replay and `fails` are the same fact
//! ("what did the failed checks say"), so they are read once from
//! gate.log rather than twice (CLAUDE.md §9a): the block writes the
//! replay text to a file the runner later `cat`s, and merges `fails`
//! into the receipt before it is reported.
//!
//! WHY THIS TEST RUNS THE EXTRACTOR INSTEAD OF READING IT. The sibling
//! test `build_image_retry.rs` asserts on the TEXT of a shell block, and
//! that is precisely how the `/tmp/kaniko.log` break shipped: the text
//! said "retry on a transient fault", every assertion passed, and the
//! script still died on the first line because the kaniko image has no
//! `/tmp`. A property you can only check by reading is a property you
//! are guessing at. So this test extracts the block from `run.sh`
//! exactly as it ships and EXECUTES it against crafted logs.
//!
//! Skips rather than fails when `python3` is absent, so a machine
//! without it does not manufacture a red.
