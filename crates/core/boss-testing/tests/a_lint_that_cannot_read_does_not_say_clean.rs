//! A lint that could not read the tree must not say `clean`.
//!
//! MEASURED 2026-09-11 (backlog 6b2f4a1a). git was refusing every command
//! in a gate workspace — `fatal: detected dubious ownership`, exit 128, as
//! uid 65534 — and of the seven lints in the pre-flight roster that ask git
//! a question, SIX answered wrongly and four of those answered green:
//!
//! | lint                           | what it said on a tree it never read |
//! |--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
//! | `no-session-paths`             | `clean`, exit 0                      |
//! | `one-palette`                  | `clean`, exit 0                      |
//! | `a-new-style-has-a-caller`     | `no trunk ref found — skipping`, 0   |
//! | `a-kind-bundle-does-not-tighten` | the same, exit 0                   |
//! | `migrations-append-only`       | `no trunk ref found … Fetch the trunk`, 1 |
//! | `steptype-bundle-ratchet`      | the same, exit 1                     |
//!
//! The trunk was present in every one of those runs. The two that exited 1
//! sent an operator after a ref that was already there; the four that
//! exited 0 are worse, because a gate records 0 as a pass and nothing
//! anywhere says the check did not happen.
//!
//! THE PROPERTY PINNED HERE, for every lint that reaches git: "git ran and
//! found nothing" and "git did not run" are different answers, and only the
//! first is `clean`. Three behaviours per lint, because a fix that only
//! made the third one work would be worse than the defect — an
//! unconditionally passing check:
//!
//!   1. git healthy, tree clean  -> exit 0, says clean
//!   2. git healthy, a REAL violation -> non-zero, NAMES the offender
//!   3. git cannot answer        -> exit 3, names the lint, the git
//!      command, the status, and git's own words; never `clean`
//!
//! Everything runs in a fixture repo this process owns: a real git repo
//! with a trunk ref, the scripts copied out of the working tree, and no
//! dependence on the ambient repository's ownership — which is the very
//! thing that was broken when this was found, and would otherwise decide
//! whether the test passes.
//!
//! Case 3 is produced two independent ways, because they reach different
//! code: `GIT_TEST_ASSUME_DIFFERENT_OWNER=1` is a real foreign-owner
//! refusal at repository discovery, and a `PATH` shim that exits 128 on a
//! named subcommand is the general form — it covers the corrupt-object and
//! unreadable-index failures ownership cannot reproduce, and it is the only
//! way to break ONE git call while leaving a lint's own git-using
//! self-test working.
