//! Every executable a test writes goes through
//! `boss_testing::scratch::write_exec`. An inline `std::fs::write` +
//! `set_permissions(0o755)` still carries the ETXTBSY race that
//! `write_exec` was rebuilt to remove, so this pin greps the crates
//! tree and refuses a new one by `file:line`.
//!
//! THE CLASS (backlog 6eaef658, 2026-09-18; this pin is 62fc6f0c).
//! Linux refuses to exec a file any process holds open for writing.
//! The writer closes its descriptor before the exec — and the exec
//! still lost, once in a full run, because the holder was not the
//! writer: a child spawned by a SIBLING test thread inherits every open
//! descriptor of the process until its own exec, so a write descriptor
//! open at the instant any other test spawns is briefly open in that
//! child too. Reproduced 8/8 with four spawner threads; `write_exec`
//! now streams the body through a child that has exited before the
//! call returns, and was 0/20 red after. Every site that writes an
//! executable WITHOUT it — `std::fs::write` then `set_permissions`,
//! `File::create` then `write!`, `std::fs::copy` then chmod — is the
//! same race, waiting for the run where two spawns line up. Twenty-six
//! such lines were measured on 2026-09-19 (grep for `from_mode` with an
//! executable octal under crates/), six of them private `write_exec`
//! copies that predate the shared one (CLAUDE.md §9a: a fact that
//! lives twice).
//!
//! THE RULE. A line under `crates/` that sets an executable bit from
//! this process — `from_mode`, `set_mode` or `OpenOptions::mode` with
//! an octal whose owner digit has the execute bit — is refused, except in
//! `boss-testing/src/scratch.rs` (the one definition), or when the
//! line or the comment line directly above it carries
//! `mode-bits-ok: <reason>`, a declaration of why THIS chmod is not an
//! executable this process then runs (a directory made traversable, a
//! downloaded binary renamed over the CLI and never exec'd here). The
//! marker needs a reason of more than one word — a bare marker is a
//! rubber stamp, the same rule `a-fixture-path-cannot-be-a-literal`
//! holds its `shared-tmp-ok` to.
//!
//! TWO MORE SHAPES, NO CHMOD (backlog eed361e0, 2026-09-26). A
//! `std::fs::copy` keeps the source's execute bit, and a `std::fs::write`
//! over a file already executable keeps its own — both hold the file
//! open in this process, and neither spells an octal. The live site was
//! `undeclared_objects_sh.rs`: a copy, then a raw write, of a `0755`
//! derivation its lint execs as `"$DERIVE" --list`. A grep cannot know a
//! runtime mode, so the rule reads the one static sign there is: a copy
//! or a write whose call names a `.sh` path literal. Measured on the
//! tree at 17b7e526: 4 of the 55 lines naming `fs::copy`, and 3
//! `fs::write` calls — each a script run as `bash <path>`, sourced, or
//! a new `0644` file, and so declared. The third
//! shape is `set_permissions` handed ANOTHER file's `permissions()` —
//! a copy's mode carried over (`a_verb_declares_the_hosts_it_serves_sh`
//! `copy_dir`): 1 site. Each goes through `copy_exec` or carries the
//! marker. A copy whose path is a variable (`DERIVE_REL`) is not seen;
//! the pin narrows the class, it does not close it.
//!
//! NO REFUSED SHAPE IS SPELLED IN THIS FILE. The needles are split
//! from the digit that makes them executable, and the fixtures below
//! assemble them at runtime, so this file is scanned by the scanner it
//! proves — no self-exclusion, which would be a hole exactly where the
//! next author is working.
//!
//! tree-wide pin — it scans a tree no changed-file map can attribute
//! to this crate, so every scoped gate runs it whatever its scope
//! (`tree_wide_pins` in infra/gate.sh; backlog c87ad472).
