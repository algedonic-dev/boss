//! `infra/lint/no-tenant-vocabulary-above-its-tier.sh` is RUN, not read
//! — against synthetic trees, so every property below is one the lint
//! actually has.
//!
//! THE CLASS (backlog be39298f). The tier rule — no tenant-specific
//! assumptions in BOSS core (CLAUDE.md §10) — was enforced only as a
//! Cargo dependency audit. Nothing counted tenant VOCABULARY, so on
//! 2026-09-16 a grep for the brewery's words outside the brewery found
//! 362 files across every tier above it: kegs in core registries, excise
//! in module ledgers, the brewery simulator in an orchestrator crate.
//! Each concentration is its own car; this lint is the SENSOR with a
//! ratchet that stops the number rising while those cars land, and holds
//! it at zero afterwards.
//!
//! THE SHAPE. The word list is the tenant's own (`examples/<tenant>/
//! VOCABULARY`), the count is derived from the tree on every run, and the
//! baseline (`infra/lint/tenant-vocabulary.baseline`, one line per tier)
//! may only be REWRITTEN DOWN, in the same car that lowers the count
//! (CLAUDE.md §9a). So there are four verdicts on a tier, and this file
//! owns all four: above the baseline is refused naming the file; equal
//! is clean; below is refused too, telling the author to lower the
//! baseline — which is also what stops anyone raising it.
//!
//! Fixtures live under `boss_testing::scratch`, which carries the uid
//! and the pid. The fixture vocabulary is invented (`wibble`, `flurble`)
//! so nothing here spells a real tenant's word: a test that carried one
//! would be one more leak for the lint it proves to count, were test
//! files not excluded — and the exclusion is one of the properties
//! pinned below, so the fixture must not depend on it.
