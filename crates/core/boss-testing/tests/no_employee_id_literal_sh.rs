//! `infra/lint/no-employee-id-literal.sh` is RUN, not read — against
//! synthetic trees, so every property below is one the lint actually
//! has.
//!
//! THE CLASS (backlog 3c23662d, design 42277636, audit H6). On
//! 2026-09-18 sixteen production lines named a person: `"emp-david"` as
//! the `owner_id` of every packet the platform files — every car
//! (Tier-1 `boss_jobs::car`), gate-run, design doc, conductor alarm,
//! estate/cadence/sensor/DNS alarm, the forge watchdog's alert, the
//! nightly install-smoke red — and `"emp-cto"` twice in the bootstrap
//! walk's synthetic sign-off. Each was one deployment's fact in code
//! every deployment runs. The car that added this lint removed all
//! sixteen; the lint is what keeps the count at zero, and this file is
//! what keeps the lint honest.
//!
//! WHY THIS TEST AND NOT ONLY THE LINT'S `--self-test`: the self-test
//! owns "the SCANNER still matches" (mawk answers an interval by
//! matching nothing, and that is invisible from outside); this file owns
//! "the lint's VERDICT on a tree" — clean exits 0, a violation exits 1
//! naming file, line and id, and a tree it cannot read exits 3 rather
//! than certifying it.
//!
//! The fixture bodies write the id prefix as `%E`, expanded at runtime,
//! so the shapes this file plants are not also lines in it; this file
//! lives under `tests/` and is exempt regardless, but a proof that
//! commits what it forbids is worth less.
