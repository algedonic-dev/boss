//! A pre-flight lint that reads the system of record waits out a
//! rollout the way the door does — through the SAME function.
//!
//! MEASURED 2026-09-23 (backlog 834ddb7c): gate-run 44da8e5a was refused
//! before any check ran, because
//! `the-live-protocols-are-the-authored-protocols` curled the jobs API
//! during a stack rollout (train #576 converging) and got HTTP 000; the
//! relaunch a minute later went green on the same diff. The door
//! (`infra/dev/boss-api`) had learned to wait out that dark minute that
//! morning (034002b3, #572), and the three lints that curl a registry
//! themselves had not, so every rollout could refuse any gate that
//! launched inside it. The refusal was correct — exit 3 is an
//! infrastructure refusal, not a red (a26f92c4) — but a refusal still
//! costs a relaunch, and the machine could have waited instead.
//!
//! The wait is ONE definition, `curl_through_a_roll` in
//! `infra/lib/curl-through-a-roll.sh`, sourced by the door and, through
//! `infra/lint/lib/sor-read.sh`, by every lint that reads a registry. A
//! second copy is the defect (CLAUDE.md §9a), so the first test counts
//! definitions across `infra/`.
//!
//! The lints run from the repo root against a stub `curl` on PATH that
//! refuses the way real curl does (exit 7, `000` on stdout) and a stub
//! `sleep` that records the wait and returns at once, so the backoff is
//! read without being spent.
