//! A gate that cannot record its verdict has to say so truthfully.
//!
//! THE INCIDENT (cf0021ae, 2026-08-25). `infra/gate.sh` passed 30/30 on
//! `chore/the-build-leaves-the-control-plane`, wrote `verdict: green`,
//! and then w-1 rebooted before the pod finished. The verdict existed
//! in exactly two places and both went quiet at once:
//!
//! - the receipt was on the PVC, and had to be recovered by mounting
//!   the disk in a throwaway pod;
//! - the step write was refused, because the gate-run packet had been
//!   reused across relaunches and was already TERMINAL.
//!
//! The fallback said `packet will go overdue (the alarm still works)`.
//! That is true of an OPEN packet and false of a closed one — a
//! terminal packet can never go overdue, so the reassurance was
//! strongest exactly where it was wrong.
//!
//! Two properties are pinned. The first is cheap insurance: the verdict
//! goes to stdout unconditionally, so `kubectl logs` is a third copy
//! that needs no volume mount. The second is the one that matters: the
//! failure branch must distinguish an open packet from a terminal one,
//! and must not promise an alarm in the case where none can fire.
