//! AN IMAGE OUTLIVES ITS TRAIN, NOT ITS CLOCK.
//!
//! The forge's routine CI-image pass could legally collect NOTHING.
//! Measured 2026-09-11 (backlog `9195a2a6`, ops-request `28d3599c`): the
//! system docker daemon held 13 `boss-ci:<sha>` tags, 21.18 GB with
//! 18.58 GB reclaimable, and their ages spanned fifteen minutes to five
//! hours — every one of them inside the routine pass's SIX-HOUR window.
//! The pass was not failing; it was correctly declining. The window was
//! sized when the forge ran 5-14 trains a day and the measured rate is
//! now ~2.6 an hour (~60 a day), which alone guarantees ~16 images are
//! always in-window. That is the whole pile.
//!
//! AN AGE WINDOW IS A PROXY for "this image will not be needed again",
//! and the proxy broke when the rate changed. What actually makes a
//! `boss-ci:<sha>` collectable is that ITS TRAIN HAS LANDED OR BEEN
//! ABANDONED — and the system of record knows that exactly: a
//! `pr-train` packet records the sha CI built (`assemble`'s `train_ref`,
//! `train/<window>@<sha>`) and the sha it merged (`merged`'s
//! `merge_ref`), and the packet is CLOSED when the train is done. So the
//! fix replaces a heuristic about time with the fact the record already
//! holds, and it self-tunes: it does not care whether the rate is 5 or
//! 60 trains a day. All 13 images measured above resolve to closed
//! trains (verified against the SoR while writing this).
//!
//! WHAT THIS FILE PINS, and the second group matters more than the
//! first:
//!
//! 1. THE FIX. A sha whose train has landed is collectable INSIDE the
//!    age window, which is what no mechanism could do before.
//!
//! 2. THE SAFETY PROPERTY, which is one sentence: EVERY FAILURE PATH
//!    PRUNES LESS, NEVER MORE. An unreachable system of record, a reply
//!    that does not parse, a reply that sees no trains (the
//!    unauthenticated read returns an empty page, not an error), an
//!    unset `BOSS_JOBS_URL`, a sha that resolves to no train, and a sha
//!    an OPEN train still references all land on the age window — the
//!    behaviour that shipped before this change. A reclaim that widens
//!    when it cannot see is how an outage becomes a data-loss incident,
//!    so the landed set can only ever ADD a reason to collect, and an
//!    empty one leaves the pass exactly as it was.
//!
//! The sweep is RUN, not read: `df`, `docker` and `curl` are stubs on
//! `PATH` and in the env knobs the script already exposes, so every
//! verdict below is one `infra/forge/disk-floor-sweep.sh` actually
//! reached. Nothing here touches a daemon, a disk or the SoR.
