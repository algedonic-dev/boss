//! `infra/lint/a-sh-script-parses-under-sh.sh` is RUN, not read —
//! against synthetic trees, so every property below is one the lint
//! actually has.
//!
//! THE CLASS (2026-09-18, estate alarms 356e1885 "forge unobserved" and
//! 2d5e26fd "boss-gcp observe-host failed"). Train #439 turned
//! `printf '%s' "$1" | sed … | head -n 1` in infra/estate/observe-lib.sh
//! into a here-string — the repair the producer-coin pin names for a
//! bash script — and the gate was green because the only lint that runs
//! that library sources it into bash. Its first line says `#!/bin/sh`;
//! on the forge and boss-gcp that is dash, which refuses `<<<` at parse
//! time, so every observer firing after 04:16Z died on line 69 before
//! its first command ran. Six hours of two hosts unobserved, for one
//! token the tree's own shebang had already forbidden.
//!
//! WHY THIS TEST AND NOT ONLY THE LINT'S `--self-test`: the self-test
//! owns "dash still refuses and the regex still matches"; this file owns
//! the VERDICT on a tree — a tree of honest shebangs exits 0 and says
//! how many it parsed, a sh script needing bash exits 1 naming file and
//! line, a bash script using bash is not the lint's business, and a tree
//! it cannot read exits 3 rather than certifying it.
