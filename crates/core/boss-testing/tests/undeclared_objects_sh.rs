//! `infra/cluster/undeclared-objects.sh` is RUN, not read — against a
//! stubbed `kubectl` and a fixture manifest tree, so every verdict below
//! is one the script actually reached. Nothing here touches a cluster.
//!
//! WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, SEPARATELY FROM THE VERB'S (backlog 19aa75e0).
//! The derivation answers one question — "what is running that the tree
//! does not declare" — and two programs read the answer: the orphan lint
//! reports it, and `delete-orphan-object` DERIVES ITS AUTHORITY from it.
//! So the failure mode that matters is not a wrong orphan; it is a
//! SMALLER declared set. A manifest that will not parse drops every
//! object it declares out of the declared set, and a declared object
//! then reads as UNDECLARED — which, at the other end of the verb, is a
//! path to deleting it.
//!
//! `delete_orphan_object_sh.rs` covers that through `--check`, the one
//! mode the verb calls. It is the narrow mode: `--list` and `--declared`
//! are the modes the LINT reads, and their refusal was pinned by
//! nothing. These tests pin all three, and pin the two properties a
//! refusal needs in order to be read as one:
//!
//!   * it NAMES the file that would not parse, and
//!   * its exit code is distinguishable from both "clean" and "found an
//!     orphan" — which in `--list` share exit 0, so a consumer that only
//!     tests `-ne 0` cannot tell a refusal from a finding.
//!
//! Plus the reasons a refusal must carry rather than drop: a pair this
//! credential cannot list, and an object it cannot read, each with the
//! server's own words. "Could not look" reduced to a count is the
//! record thrown away before the reader sees it (CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis).
//!
//! THE LINT IS EXERCISED HERE TOO, out of the same fixture, because it is
//! the consumer — and because the other half of 19aa75e0 was that it held
//! a SECOND copy of these rules: its own $EXCLUDED_KINDS, $EXEMPT,
//! $EXEMPT_ANY_NS, $is_exempt and its own sweep of the cluster. Two
//! definitions of "what the tree does not declare" differ in exactly the
//! places nobody compared (CLAUDE.md §9a), and at the far end of
//! `delete-orphan-object` a divergence is a path to deleting a DECLARED
//! object. So the lint's half of this file asserts a COLLAPSE rather than
//! a second copy: make the two disagree, and the lint must follow the
//! derivation instead of itself. A test that only checked the answers
//! would pass just as well against two copies that happen to agree today.
