//! The gate rig is infrastructure, and infrastructure that only exists
//! on a cluster is infrastructure nobody can reproduce.
//!
//! TWO FAILURES ON 2026-08-26, both silent, both found by reading.
//!
//! THE SCRIPT DRIFTED. The gate Job cannot run `run.sh` out of the
//! clone, because `run.sh` is what performs the clone — so it reaches
//! the pod through ConfigMap `gate-runner-script`. The manifest carried
//! the regeneration command in a COMMENT and asked whoever applied it
//! to remember. The live ConfigMap held the script from
//! `perf/the-gate-uses-the-cpu-it-was-given`, a branch measured 16%
//! slower and deliberately never parked, while main carried something
//! else. Ten gates ran that day and every receipt was produced by a
//! script that is not in this repository. CLAUDE.md §9a: a comment
//! asking the next person to keep two copies in sync is not a
//! mechanism. `apply-script-configmap.sh` is the mechanism, and
//! `--check` answers "is the thing that ran the thing I have?".
//!
//! THE MANIFEST WAS NEVER TRACKED AT ALL. The variant that made six
//! concurrent gates possible existed only in an agent job's scratch
//! directory — one `rm -rf` from taking the capability with it. It is
//! `gate-runner-local.yaml` now.
//!
//! What these tests defend is the DIFFERENCE between the two manifests.
//! It looks like duplication and invites unification, and unifying them
//! is exactly the mistake: a claimed workspace cannot be shared, and a
//! per-pod one is the only reason gates can run side by side.
