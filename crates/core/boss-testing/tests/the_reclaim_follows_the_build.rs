//! THE RECLAIM FOLLOWS THE BUILD.
//!
//! Measured on the forge host, 2026-09-11 (backlog `0357e0eb`): six
//! consecutive observations fifteen minutes apart read 89, 100, 99,
//! **60**, 92, 98 GB free of 227. The locomotive refuses to START a CI
//! run below 70 GB (`infra/forge/locomotive.sh`, `BOSS_CI_MIN_FREE_GB`),
//! so the 04:03 trough sat ten gigabytes under the door a train boards
//! through — and a locomotive refusal happens BEFORE any check runs, so
//! it says nothing about the branch while striking every car aboard.
//! Four clean cars lost five departures that way on 2026-08-22 and a
//! whole day went to holding on 2026-09-05.
//!
//! THE CAUSE IS A CADENCE MISMATCH, NOT A SHORTAGE, and both floors are
//! individually right. The FILL is event-driven: every CI run builds and
//! pulls a per-train `boss-ci:<sha>` image into the system docker
//! daemon. The RECLAIM is timer-driven: `disk-floor-sweep.timer` runs
//! hourly and its unit defends 100 GB — deliberately higher than the
//! locomotive's 70, so a floor buys headroom above the one being
//! defended. A dip whose amplitude exceeds that 30 GB gap, inside one
//! timer interval, walks straight through it.
//!
//! So the reclaim must follow the EVENT that fills the disk. The
//! mechanism was already complete and only the trigger was missing: the
//! forge runs an ops-runner on a ~1-minute poll, and `reclaim-disk` is
//! an allowlisted bounded verb (`infra/ops/verbs.json`) that runs the
//! SAME `disk-floor-sweep.sh` the timer runs. `request-reclaim-disk.sh`
//! is the trigger, and the CI workflow — which already runs on every
//! train, green or red, and needs no install step on the host — is what
//! fires it.
//!
//! What is pinned here:
//!  - the workflow actually asks, after the heavy jobs, whatever their
//!    verdict (a red train's CI filled the disk just the same);
//!  - the request is the allowlisted verb with the allowlisted shape;
//!  - the floor it asks for is the floor the sweep's own unit defends,
//!    read out of that unit rather than copied beside it (CLAUDE.md §9a
//!    — one number wearing two names is how the sweep and the
//!    locomotive drifted before);
//!  - nothing about this can fail a CI run. An accelerator that reds a
//!    train would cause the exact strike it exists to prevent, and the
//!    hourly timer remains the independent floor.
