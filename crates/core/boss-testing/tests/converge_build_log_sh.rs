//! A failed converge says WHY — `infra/forge/cluster-deploy-runner.sh`'s
//! build block, RUN against a stub `docker`, not read.
//!
//! THE DEFECT (backlog ddb0f7bd, measured 2026-09-09). The runner built
//! with `docker build -q`. Train 283 merged at 03:40:26 and its converge
//! failed four times — 03:46:38, 03:55:07, 04:04:23, 04:14:29 — and the
//! record held the Dockerfile context dump, a one-line ERROR, and
//! nothing the compiler said. Recovering even the exit code meant
//! reading an untruncated journal line by hand. Ruling out a compile
//! error took a workspace check on another box (it passed, in both
//! profiles); ruling out a full disk took a `disk-report` ops-request
//! (101 GB free). Neither question should have needed asking: the build
//! knew and was told not to speak.
//!
//! `-q` suppresses OUTPUT, not work — it saves no build time — so the
//! only thing it bought was a quiet journal, which capturing to a file
//! buys as well while keeping the evidence. Hence: always verbose into
//! a log, print the log ONLY on failure, and stamp the head so a repeat
//! failure is legible as a repeat rather than as four unrelated ones.
//!
//! The stamp is deliberately NOT a quarantine. `FAILED_FILE` holds an
//! unbootable head out of the cluster; this one only labels the
//! attempt, because the likely causes here are transient (a registry
//! fetch losing a DNS race on this LAN, memory contention with a
//! concurrent CI job) and a retry that PASSES is itself the finding.
