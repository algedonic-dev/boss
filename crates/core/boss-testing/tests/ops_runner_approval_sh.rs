//! The ops-runner EXECUTES a passkey-approved verb, and refuses every
//! approval it cannot verify (backlog fd7090cc, design 17835005).
//!
//! THE GAP THIS CLOSES, measured on origin/main 87c2e366 (2026-09-23).
//! The design had two halves on main: a destructive verb renders a plan
//! first (`plan-a-pod-reap`, `plan-a-tenant-merge`, each printing the
//! plan on stdout and `plan-sha256:` on stderr, the write re-rendering
//! and comparing), and ops-request v2 carries an `approve` sign-off step
//! with `assurance_required = "presence"`, so a passkey stamp binds
//! `step_shape_hash(title, metadata)` — the plan bytes on that step. The
//! third half was missing: the runner refused EVERY `requires_approval`
//! verb ("nothing issues one yet"), nothing wrote a plan onto the approve
//! step, so David's passkey approved nothing.
//!
//! WHAT THE RUNNER DOES NOW, and what these cases pin:
//!
//! - an approve step that is ready with no plan gets the verb's declared
//!   `plan_verb` rendered on the host and written onto it through the step
//!   metadata door; a plan verb that refuses closes the request refused,
//!   carrying its words;
//! - `execute` runs only when the approve step is COMPLETED and carries,
//!   for every required role, a PRESENCE stamp bound to the step's
//!   current shape hash — recomputed here, pinned equal to
//!   `boss_core::job::step_shape_hash` by the happy path below (§9a);
//! - the approval is single-use (execute is claimed `active` before the
//!   argv runs, and an `active` execute is never run again) and
//!   time-boxed (`APPROVAL_TTL_S`, ten minutes);
//! - the write gets sha256 of the SIGNED plan as its `plan_sha256`, so a
//!   state that drifted since the signature re-renders to different bytes
//!   and the write's own script refuses it.
//!
//! q2, as David ruled it: the runner trusts the system of record, and a
//! writable field is never an approval. Every refusal names what it
//! refused, on the request itself.
//!
//! Run against a stubbed system of record (a `curl` on PATH that serves
//! one packet on GET and logs every write, in order), so each verdict is
//! one the runner actually made.
