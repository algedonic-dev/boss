//! `infra/gate.sh` is the documented pre-push door (CLAUDE.md §Doors),
//! and since #310 (2026-09-11) the gate itself runs as uid 65534 / gid
//! 1500 — which is also the uid every builder brief now tells an agent
//! to verify work under. The dev pod's checkout is root-owned
//! (`drwxrwsr-x root 1500`), so since git 2.35.2 every git command run
//! by any other uid refuses it:
//!
//!     fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/work/boss'
//!
//! MEASURED as 65534 before the fix (packet 8674c440): `--quick` exits 1
//! naming `migrations-append-only`, `no-secrets` and
//! `steptype-bundle-ratchet`. That list is the loud third of the defect.
//! Five lints are affected and they fail three different ways:
//!
//! | lint | git call | what it does |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `no-secrets` | `git ls-files` | FAILS, printing the refusal |
//! | `migrations-append-only` | trunk `rev-parse` | refusal swallowed by `2>/dev/null`; fails claiming "no trunk ref found … Fetch the trunk" |
//! | `steptype-bundle-ratchet` | trunk `rev-parse` | same wrong diagnosis |
//! | `no-session-paths` | `git grep` via `lib/pattern-scan.sh` | `|| true` — reports `clean` on a tree it never read |
//! | `one-palette` | `git grep` | `|| true` — reports `clean` likewise |
//!
//! The last pair is the reason the fix belongs in `gate.sh` rather than
//! in the lints: a SILENT FALSE PASS has no red to notice, so a per-lint
//! fix has to find five call sites and would have to keep finding them
//! (CLAUDE.md §9a).
//!
//! ## Why this file exists beside `gate_sh.rs`
//!
//! `gate_sh.rs` pins the gate's DEFINITION (one roster, no second
//! inline copy in CI). This pins the gate's ENVIRONMENT: that a child
//! of the gate can read git at all. Different question, and on
//! 2026-09-11 a separate car was already in flight on `gate_sh.rs`, so
//! a new file is also the non-colliding place to put it.
//!
//! ## Why no `chown`, and why this holds as root
//!
//! A test cannot create a foreign-owned directory without root, and the
//! gate has no root. `GIT_TEST_ASSUME_DIFFERENT_OWNER` is git's own
//! "pretend another user owns this" knob, so these tests reproduce the
//! uid-65534 refusal while running as ANY uid — root included. That is
//! the property that makes them trustworthy on the runner: they do not
//! pass merely because the account happened to own the tree.
