//! A lint that scanned nothing is red — and every lint in the pre-flight
//! roster either says how many things it scanned, or is listed here with
//! the reason it is not a scanner.
//!
//! MEASURED 2026-09-18 (backlog cdf2d959, tech-debt audit H2). Two lints
//! in the roster had been exiting 0 `clean` on every gate for months
//! while examining zero things:
//!
//! | lint                 | why it scanned nothing                         |
//! |----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
//! | `sim-boundary-audit` | its awk used `\s`, which mawk reads as a       |
//! |                      | literal `s`; 0 dependency lines matched, so its |
//! |                      | 6-entry allowlist was never compared to anything|
//! | `seed-bypass-smell`  | it globbed `examples/*/seeds/sql/`, a directory |
//! |                      | retired with the playground bundles             |
//!
//! Both PRINTED the zero — "0 dep declarations scanned", "no seed sql
//! files" — and nothing read it. CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis: "a check nobody
//! reads is a check that is not running." A summary line that no reader
//! turns into a verdict is prose; this file is the reader.
//!
//! THE RULE PINNED HERE. A scanning lint prints `<lint>: scanned <N>
//! <what>` (through `infra/lint/lib/scanned.sh`) and exits 1 when N is
//! 0. This test runs every lint in the gate's own pre-flight roster
//! against the tree and reads the line back: a scanner that prints no
//! count, or a count of 0, fails BY NAME. A lint that is not a scanner —
//! a fixture-driven self-test of one script, a one-file assertion, a
//! branch-diff check that is empty on the trunk by construction — is
//! listed in [`NOT_SCANNERS`] with its reason, and an entry there naming
//! a lint that no longer exists is refused the same way a stale
//! allowlist entry is (`infra/lint/lib/allowlist.sh`). Nothing is
//! skipped silently: every lint is in exactly one of the two sets.
//!
//! The roster is asked of `infra/gate.sh --roster`, never re-derived
//! from the directory: the four lints the gate does not pre-flight
//! (live-DB sweeps, a built-binary check, the web install) are excluded
//! THERE, once, and pinned by gate_sh.rs.
