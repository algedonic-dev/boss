//! `infra/forge/read-publish-checks.sh` is RUN, not read — against the
//! public GitHub API's own answers for PR #239, copied into
//! `tests/fixtures/github/` on 2026-09-19, with every outside party a
//! stub (a `curl` that serves those files and records every write) and
//! never the network.
//!
//! THE GAP (backlog 321f1409). A mirror publish PR's CodeQL result never
//! returned to the system of record: PR #238 was merged over 64 unread
//! alerts (18 critical) on 2026-09-12 and #239 stalled on 109 (10
//! critical) a week later, and nothing inside BOSS had read either —
//! the check runs after the publish packet's sign-off, on a surface only
//! David sees, at merge time. Measured from the pod over the public API:
//! of the 100 annotations GitHub exposes for #239, 81 are
//! cleartext-logging on a name heuristic (account_id / employee_id /
//! uid in a log line), 9 hard-coded-cryptographic-value on `#[cfg(test)]`
//! constants, and the rest of the same kind — zero real findings. A
//! check nobody reads is a check that is not running (CLAUDE.md
//! §Diagnosis); this verb is the reader, and these cases pin what it
//! reads:
//!
//!   * with every check-run completed, the reading lands on the publish
//!     packet's metadata as `code_scanning` — one entry per check with
//!     its conclusion, and for the code-scanning check the annotation
//!     counts by rule and by file, every number equal to the fixture's
//!     — and the `read-checks` step is completed with `conclusion` and
//!     `alerts`; the LAST line is the answer line the dispatcher rule's
//!     `verdict_pattern` reads (one fact, two files, CLAUDE.md §9a);
//!   * with a check-run still running, nothing is written until it
//!     completes, and past the deadline the verb FAILS naming the run
//!     still in flight — a partial reading, never a clean one;
//!   * only the code-scanning checks are waited for (backlog d167e7d7):
//!     a non-scanning check still running — the mirror's full gate —
//!     is recorded as running and does not hold the reading;
//!   * a publish packet whose `open-pr` step recorded no head sha is a
//!     refusal naming the step, not a read of nothing;
//!   * `--check` asks only for the tools and the addresses, no network.
