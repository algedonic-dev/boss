//! The nightly backup must leave a packet — and never lie in it.
//!
//! WHAT WAS BROKEN (backlog 60095754, measured 2026-09-08). The cluster
//! CronJob `boss-pg-backup` runs at 09:10 UTC and SUCCEEDS: its three
//! most recent Jobs read Complete, the artefact verifies, both offsite
//! legs ship. The system of record had not seen a backup since
//! 2026-08-19, because the packet-filing lived on the RETIRED boss-gcp
//! host timer (`infra/boss-backup.service`, whose ExecStartPre called
//! `boss-maintenance-wrap.sh maintenance-backup`) and the CronJob that
//! replaced it at the 2026-09-04 cutover never took the wrap with it.
//! Seven of the nine cluster CronJobs call the wrap; this was the only
//! nightly maintenance job the SoR could not see. CLAUDE.md §Diagnosis:
//! a check nobody reads is a check that is not running — and once the
//! silence sweep alarms on this kind, its first alarm is
//! indistinguishable from a real backup failure.
//!
//! WHY THIS TEST EXECUTES THE MANIFEST INSTEAD OF READING IT. A textual
//! assertion can say the wrap is mentioned; it cannot say the packet
//! OPENS before the dump, CLOSES after both offsite legs, and — the
//! property that matters most — does NOT close green when the dump or
//! the upload fails. So the container scripts are lifted out of
//! `boss-backup.yaml` exactly as they ship, every absolute path they
//! name rebased into a scratch dir this run owns outright, and run under
//! bash in the order Kubernetes runs them: initContainers in sequence,
//! STOP at the first failure, then the main containers.
//!
//! WHAT IS FAKED, AND WHY ONLY THAT. `pg_dump`, `ssh`, `gcloud` and
//! `apk` come from the container images and cannot run here, so they
//! are shims that record what they were asked to do. `gzip`, `du`,
//! `find`, `grep` and `tail` are the real thing, so the artefact
//! verification this manifest is written around is genuinely exercised
//! — including the case it exists for, a `pg_dump` that dies mid-stream
//! and leaves a perfectly valid gzip.
//!
//! `boss-maintenance-wrap.sh` and `boss-step.sh` are shimmed too, and
//! that is a deliberate choice rather than a shortcut. Driving the real
//! ones needs `jq`, which the CI image's own manifest
//! (`infra/forge/boss-ci/required-tools.txt`) does not promise and the
//! dev pod does not have — two lints already say so in their output
//! ("no jq on this box") and skip a branch each. A test that skips is a
//! check that is not running, and this one must run everywhere.
//! Their HTTP behaviour is already pinned where it belongs, by
//! `infra/lint/timers-leave-a-packet.sh` check 6, and is shared
//! unchanged with seven sibling CronJobs. What is NEW here, and what
//! nothing else could see, is the POD: which leg opens the packet, when
//! it closes, what it carries, and what happens when a leg fails. The
//! shims record their argv, so this test reads the exact call the
//! manifest makes.
