//! `infra/forge/probe-bin/boss-sor-read` — the one way a car's recorded
//! probe reads the system of record on the forge: GET-only, base and
//! identity supplied by the door that runs the probe, never by the
//! probe's own text.
//!
//! THE DOOR is `boss prove <car> --from-car --unattended`
//! (crates/orchestrators/boss-cli/src/prove.rs), what the forge's
//! ops-runner runs for a `run-car-probe` ops-request. Until backlog
//! 9f00a805 (consolidation H8, car 2, 2026-09-18) it was the shell twin
//! infra/forge/run-car-probe.sh, and this file was that script's pin:
//! it lifted the script's prelude and verdict blocks out and RAN them,
//! and read the reader's role out of the script's `PROBE-READER` block.
//! The twin is retired and those pins went with it — the prelude, the
//! verdict and the reader identity are Rust now, tested beside their
//! definition (`prove.rs`, "THE UNATTENDED DOOR"). What stays here is
//! the READER, which is still a shell script in the tree: it ships in
//! the checkout, it is executable, it refuses to read unidentified, it
//! takes a path and nothing else, and it routes a path to its service's
//! port by the table the door hands it (design 28d2bed9). The equality
//! pin between that table, the Service manifest and boss-ports is
//! the_machine_door_carries_every_read_surface.rs.

// A PROBE READS THE SYSTEM OF RECORD AS A NAMED READER (61085a9e).
//
// THE DEFECT, measured 2026-09-10 against one backend at one commit.
// The shell twin built the right `x-boss-user` header for its OWN three
// calls — read the car, write the verdict, patch the attempt — and
// handed the probe an env carrying only `BOSS_JOBS_URL`. So a probe
// doing `curl $BOSS_JOBS_URL/api/...` reads as `operator:unidentified`,
// and policy answers a NARROWER WORLD without saying so:
//
//   /api/jobs?kind=pr-train&status=open        operator 1  → 0
//   /api/jobs?kind=ship-a-change&status=open           21  → 0
//   /api/jobs?kind=backlog-item&status=open            30  → 0
//   /api/yard/status  trains/dock/recent/dock_depth 1/1/8/1 → all 0
//   /api/workflows                                     84  → 84 (same)
//
// Per-surface, with nothing in the answer to say which kind you hit.
// `/api/yard/status` comes back a confident, well-formed, completely
// idle yard: no trains, nothing on the dock, threshold not met.
//
// WHY THAT IS WORSE THAN A BROKEN READ. A PRESENCE assertion fails for
// the wrong reason and reads as a false negative about the car —
// recoverable, because someone investigates. An ABSENCE assertion
// PASSES FALSELY: "no open job of kind X remains" is green against an
// empty page the probe was never allowed to see. That is a proof that
// vouches for nothing, recorded as a proof, on a car that then closes.
// It caught the person who filed the item twice in one hour.
//
// THE FIX, and why it is not one line. Exporting the door's own
// write actor would hand every car's probe text a platform-admin
// credential with WRITE capability, and a probe is program text
// authored upstream and run as david on the forge. So the probe gets a
// SEPARATE, READ-SCOPED actor (`audit-readonly`: core policy grants it
// Read at Scope::All on every shipped resource and no other action at
// all) plus a GET-only reader on its PATH whose header comes from the
// door, never from the probe's text.
