//! `infra/forge/sweep-archive-branches.sh` is RUN, not read — against a
//! stubbed `kubectl` (the Secret and the archive's one psql answer are
//! files) and a REAL bare git repository standing in for the forge (the
//! fixture checkout's `forgejo` remote), so a delete is a delete the
//! read-back can observe and a dry run's "pushed nothing" is measured
//! on the remote itself. Nothing here touches a cluster or a database.
//!
//! WHY THE VERB EXISTS (backlog dfd83788, measured 2026-09-17 06:30Z):
//! `boss orient` listed 50 forge heads no packet claims. The arrival
//! sweep deletes a landed car's branch on the JOB RECORD's evidence
//! (train.rs `deletable_branches` + `sweep_guard`), and every car that
//! landed before the 2026-09-16 23:55Z database switch lives in the
//! ARCHIVE database, not the system of record — so the sweep can never
//! see them and the 50 are permanent. This verb applies the sweep's
//! own rule to the archive's records, through the read-only psql door
//! tenant-census uses and the checkout's forgejo remote.
//!
//! THE SECOND SOURCE (backlog 2c10a25d, measured 2026-09-17 08:00Z):
//! the first dry run (ops-request 54547b33) planned 6 of 50 orphans —
//! the cars of trains #384–#411 closed inside the converge hold and
//! after the database switch, so no database recorded their landing.
//! The forge did: `refs/pull/N/head` is the assembled consist of train
//! PR N, main carries `… (#N)` when N merged, and a branch head that is
//! an ANCESTOR of a merged PR's head landed with it (37 of the 50, by
//! `git merge-base --is-ancestor`). The same run showed two defects:
//! the record named all 1,014 GONE branches (184 KB, cut at the
//! runner's 102,400-byte cap, taking the plan off the packet), and the
//! `unrecorded` set held the live system of record's own open cars.
//!
//! What each case pins:
//!
//!   * THE DECISION IS THE SWEEP'S. A branch is deleted iff a closed,
//!     `merged` ship-a-change car in the archive names it (its own
//!     branch with `boarded_head`, or a `rerail_origins` entry with its
//!     head) AND the forge's current head equals the recorded head.
//!     Moved = kept and named; claimed with no head = kept and named;
//!     unclaimed = kept and named (a human's decision); gone = counted,
//!     nothing to do.
//!   * PULL-REQUEST ANCESTRY IS THE SECOND EVIDENCE. A head the archive
//!     did not plan is planned with `evidence: "pull-request", pr: N`
//!     when it is an ancestor of `refs/pull/N/head` for a MERGED N (a
//!     `(#N)` subject on the forge's main), newest N first; a head only
//!     in unmerged PRs is not evidence; the delete is leased to the
//!     head that proved ancestry, so a branch that moves between the
//!     read and the push is refused by the forge and recorded `failed`.
//!   * GONE IS A COUNT. The record carries no `branches.gone` list, and
//!     a record with 1,000 gone branches and 50 heads stays under the
//!     runner's 100,000-byte cap.
//!   * A LIVE CAR'S BRANCH IS NAMED `live`, never unrecorded and never
//!     planned — even when PR ancestry would call it landed. The live
//!     record is read through `boss-sor-read` as a read-scoped actor;
//!     a reader that is absent, refuses, or answers a cut listing is a
//!     REFUSAL (unreadable live record = cannot tell live from stale).
//!   * THE ARCHIVE MUST NOT BE THE LIVE DATABASE: the Secret's
//!     database-url is parsed in a variable, the name compared, and THE
//!     PASSWORD IS NEVER PRINTED on any path.
//!   * THE VERDICT LINE IS FIRST — before the record and the per-branch
//!     lines — because the ops-runner keeps only the first 100 KB.
//!   * THE DRY RUN PUSHES NOTHING; the real run deletes exactly the
//!     planned set, reads each ref back, and records it.
//!   * THE REMOTE'S URL NEVER REACHES THE OUTPUT, even when git fails.
//!   * A RECORDED DECISION IS THE ONLY DOOR FOR THE REST (backlog
//!     a12736b1, 2026-09-18): an optional fourth argument names a job
//!     whose review is completed with an answer, and only then do the
//!     moved and unrecorded branches go too — `by decision <id>`, leased
//!     and read back like the rest; a live car's or an OPEN train's
//!     branch never. A packet that is missing, the wrong kind, unreviewed,
//!     wordless or declined is refused by name and nothing is deleted.
//!   * THE VERB FILE serves the forge, is MUTATING, and takes
//!     mode/namespace/archive_db with the switch verb's patterns, plus the
//!     optional decision as a full job id.
