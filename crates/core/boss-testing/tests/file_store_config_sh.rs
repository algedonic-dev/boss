//! The `[files]` block that turns on the packet attachment surface,
//! and the two things that must travel with it.
//!
//! `file_refs` — bytes attached to a subject, job, step or event,
//! keyed `sha256/<hex>` — has been built, tested and shipped for a
//! long time and was never switched on, so it had zero callers. This
//! pins the config that switches it on, because two of its three
//! parts fail SILENTLY when omitted:
//!
//! 1. Without `policy_api_url`, `build_files_router` falls back to
//!    `PermissivePolicyClient` and the upload/download surface runs
//!    with no policy enforcement at all — announced only by a
//!    `tracing::warn`. Turning on `[files]` without it opens an
//!    unauthenticated machine door.
//! 2. Without the store in `infra/backup.sh`, the `file_refs` rows
//!    still ride the pg_dump, so a restore produces metadata insisting
//!    bytes exist at a path holding nothing — and reports success.
//!
//! Both are read here out of the scripts themselves, so deleting
//! either line fails by name instead of by incident.
