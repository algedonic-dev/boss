//! The image build must survive one dropped DNS lookup — and must not
//! survive a broken Dockerfile three times.
//!
//! THE FAILURE THIS PINS (run 248, 2026-08-26 20:59Z). `build-image`
//! died with:
//!
//! ```text
//! error building image: Get "https://production.cloudfront.docker.com/.../data":
//!   dial tcp: lookup production.cloudfront.docker.com on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host
//! ```
//!
//! kaniko had already cached the image manifest and failed fetching a
//! BLOB, so a warm cache does not protect this path. `build-image`
//! failed and locomotive, web, fast and test were skipped — a train
//! carrying six gated cars went red with no car implicated. The forge
//! has no rerun API, so the recovery was `boss train cancel`: six cars
//! back to the dock, PR closed unmerged, and roughly two hours of gate
//! time queued to be spent again.
//!
//! Measured before fixing: 10 failures in runs 199-248, and exactly ONE
//! of them had a network signature. So this is a ~2% event, and it is
//! guarded for BLAST RADIUS rather than frequency. The chain it depends
//! on has no redundancy anywhere — container 127.0.0.11 to the host's
//! systemd-resolved stub to a single upstream at 10.20.0.1, with no
//! secondary — so one dropped answer fails the build outright.
//!
//! TWO PROPERTIES, and the second is the one worth the test. Retrying
//! everything would be easy and wrong: it turns a genuine Dockerfile
//! error into three identical failures and triples the time before
//! anyone sees the real message. The harness already draws this line
//! for the database — `boss_testing::is_transient` retries a closed
//! socket and refuses to retry a rejected statement, because "a
//! rejected statement is a defect in the change under test and must
//! fail loudly on the first try; a closed socket is weather". The image
//! build gets the same rule.
