//! The builder rules must not steer a builder into a command shape the
//! worktree-isolation guard refuses, and must say, before the first
//! rule that shows a command, what shape passes instead.
//!
//! MEASURED 2026-09-23 (backlog 68535488), across that day's builders
//! (runs 27bfbdac, 2c623d2e, 161944b2 and others). In an isolated
//! worktree the harness's guard refuses, as "too complex to verify", a
//! python3 heredoc, `cat > file <<EOF`, any command after a heredoc, a
//! compound command naming git or looping over boss-api, and `$((...))`
//! arithmetic in a loop. The rules showed exactly those shapes — a
//! `&&` chain of two git commands in rule 1, a `git show … | grep`
//! rehearsal in rule 7 — and every builder rediscovered the same way
//! round: write the script with the Write tool into the scratch dir and
//! run it by absolute path, which always passes. Rule 0 says so once,
//! and this pin holds every command the rules show to that shape.
//!
//! What it reads is the document as authored: every backticked span
//! outside rule 0 (rule 0 NAMES the refused shapes, so it is the one
//! place they may appear). A span that is a heredoc or `$((` is
//! refused wherever it stands; a span that names `git` or `boss-api`
//! must be ONE command — no `&&`, `||`, `;` or `|` — because that is
//! the class the guard refuses. Script CONTENT that is not git (the
//! gate command, a probe's `case` guard) is written into a file by the
//! rule that shows it, so it is not an inline command and not judged.
