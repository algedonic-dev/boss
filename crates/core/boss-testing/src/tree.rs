//! A compiled test binary bakes in its own `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`. On a
//! box where builders share one `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` (the dev pod does,
//! because a cold target is ~74 GB and the pod OOMs on parallel cold
//! builds), `cargo test` in worktree B can REUSE a binary that worktree
//! A built minutes earlier — and every `repo_root()` inside it then
//! points at A. Measured 2026-09-11 (3d8bb6e6): `gate_sh` built from one
//! agent worktree ran from another and reported a confident failure
//! belonging to someone else's tree; the second worktree's "13/13 green"
//! was evidence about a tree its builder was not working in. Forty
//! minutes, and the wrong-target-answers-instead-of-erroring shape from
//! CLAUDE.md §Doors at its most expensive: well-formed, confident, and
//! about a different tree.
//!
//! Twenty-seven test files carried their own six-line `repo_root()`
//! before this module (CLAUDE.md §9a — a fact that lives twice); none
//! could see the mismatch. This one can, because cargo runs every test
//! binary with the package directory as its working directory, so the
//! running cwd must lie INSIDE the compiled-in root. When it does not,
//! [`repo_root`] refuses with both paths and the remedy, instead of
//! answering with the other tree.
