// ----- who may ask about whom ---------------------------------------------
//
// Until backlog b8e75382's rule 7 (F7) the reads about a person answered
// any caller about any user, and an override's row and the deny it
// decides both carry its `reason` — free text an operator wrote about a
// person. The override list now answers the caller about itself, and
// anyone else only to a holder of Read on `policy-rule` at scope all,
// the authority to read the table those answers come from.
//
// `/check` takes the same bound WHENEVER the request is signed (backlog
// 5a914364 S1): the gateway always sets `x-boss-user` on a session's
// request, so a session asking about someone else is judged like the
// list. An UNSIGNED `/check` stays open, because every service asks it
// through `ReqwestPolicyClient` with no `x-boss-user` of its own, and a
// bound there would deny every policy check in the estate. That arm
// closes when callers sign their policy calls (e84de48e, and the
// machine token of design 6805c764); until then a caller reaching the
// port directly is the gap, pinned by
// `an_unsigned_check_still_answers_about_anyone_until_callers_sign`.
//
// The rule table (`GET /api/policy/rules`, `/rules/{id}`) is read only by
// a holder of Read on `policy-rule` at scope all — the authority to read
// the table itself, the same bound the override list's "anyone else" arm
// takes. It was left open with `/check` on the belief that the bootstrap
// read it headerless; measured on origin/main 1fccf703 (2026-09-26), every
// in-tree reader signs: `bootstrap::publish_policy_rules` sends its
// platform-admin `x-boss-user` on the GET as on the POST, tenant publish
// and export sign as the seed identity, and the policy page reaches this
// port through the gateway, which signs every session.
