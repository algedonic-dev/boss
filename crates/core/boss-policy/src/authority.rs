//! What an authorized policy writer may write (backlog b8e75382,
//! decided 2026-09-25).
//!
//! Car e2209174 (backlog 42c25542) made every policy write authorize its
//! caller against `policy-rule`. Its adversarial review then proved that
//! was not a bound: holding one policy verb let a caller grant its own
//! role the rest, a rule id could disguise the grant it carried,
//! retiring a deny override widened access while being judged a delete,
//! and nothing kept policy authority from the identities anonymous
//! visitors carry. These are the rules that bound it, as pure functions
//! of three things: what the caller holds (read through the engine
//! BEFORE the write's transaction opens), the row the write would change
//! (read INSIDE it by the adapter, see `port::Judge`), and the write.
//!
//! 1. No grant beyond what the granter holds: granting (action, resource,
//!    scope) needs the caller's own decision on that action and resource
//!    to allow a scope that contains the one granted — and the grant may
//!    last no longer than that decision does. A decision a user override
//!    made ends when the override does, so it grants nothing that
//!    outlives it: no role rule (a rule never expires) and no override
//!    ending later or never (H3 of the hold review of car a8becd52 — an
//!    hour's cover was laundered into a permanent grant). The deploy
//!    superuser is named, not derived — `boss tenant publish` seeds a
//!    tenant's grants as platform-admin, and the example tenant's alone
//!    name twenty `step-signoff:<role>` resources no default gives it.
//! 2. Break-glass repairs, it does not invent: a rule it writes must
//!    equal a row core ships, and it writes no override at all — core
//!    ships none, so none is a repair (H2). It may retire one, which
//!    returns that user to the role rules, judged like anyone's
//!    retirement.
//! 4. A write is judged by its effect: a row that exists, live or not,
//!    makes an upsert an Update; ending a live override narrower than
//!    `all` hands back whatever the user's role grants — up to `all`,
//!    since this service does not know the role — so it is a Create and
//!    a grant at `all`, whether the write retires the row or only brings
//!    its expiry forward (H1: a deny re-POSTed to expire in a second is
//!    a retirement).
//! 5. An anonymous visitor never holds policy authority, as caller or as
//!    grantee.
//!
//! Rule 3 (the id is derived, and a role carries no `:` to derive
//! another grant's id with) is a malformed request, answered 422 at the
//! door before anything here runs; rule 6 (decide inside the
//! transaction) is the shape of `port::Judge`.
//!
//! Two limits, stated because each is a place the bound is looser than a
//! reader might assume (S3 and S4 of the same review):
//!
//! - **Rule 1 compares breadth, not reach.** `self`, `team` and
//!   `territory` are relative to whoever holds them: a granter holding
//!   `team` may grant another role `team`, and the grantee's team is its
//!   own reports, not the granter's. `Scope::contains` answers "is this
//!   shape no wider", never "are these rows ones I can see".
//! - **The caller's authority is read before the transaction.** The
//!   engine is async and the judge is not, so what the caller holds is
//!   read first and only the row being written is read and locked inside
//!   the write. A change to the caller's OWN grants that commits between
//!   the two — a revocation racing a write — is not seen: that one write
//!   is judged on the authority the caller held when it was read.
