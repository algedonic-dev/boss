//! Does a rule only reference fields the event it binds actually carries?
//!
//! THE FAILURE THIS ANSWERS (filed cf7ae3b5, 2026-08-15). A rule can name
//! an identifier the event has never carried, and nothing catches it
//! until the rule fires in production. There it is not a quiet skip:
//! `expr::eval` returns `UnknownIdentifier`, the runner turns that into
//! `PredicateFailed` / `ArgFailed`, NAKs for redelivery, and the event
//! dead-letters after eight attempts.
//!
//! It has now happened twice on one topic. `spawn-car-on-sweep-remediated`
//! bound `title` against `jobs.job.closed`, which carried
//! id/closed_on/kind/outcome/parent_step_id and no title — eight WARN
//! redeliveries and a dead letter, seconds after a train merged. And one
//! of the three `jobs.job.closed` emit sites still omits `parent_step_id`
//! while a live rule gates on it (`da87e3a1`).
//!
//! WHY A ROSTER CHECK IS SOUND HERE. The evaluator's whole world is
//! `expr::Context { payload, helpers }`. Identifiers resolve against the
//! payload and nothing else — no ambient job, no system bindings — and
//! `expr::references` walks into function-call ARGUMENTS without emitting
//! the function's own name, so helpers cannot be mistaken for fields.
//! That makes "every identifier root must be a declared payload field" an
//! exact statement of what the evaluator will accept, not an approximation.
//!
//! IT IS A RATCHET, DELIBERATELY. `event_kinds.payload_fields` has existed
//! since migration 108 ("filled as consumers ... need it") and was empty
//! until this change. A kind with no declared roster is NOT checked, so
//! seeding one kind buys that kind's rules a gate without demanding a
//! complete inventory of every topic first — and a check that must be
//! total before it is useful never lands. Seed a roster, gain a gate.
