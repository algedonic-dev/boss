//! The log tail — rules consumption straight from `audit_log`
//! (transactional-audit-log Q6, stage 1; backlog `3d6d6bea`).
//!
//! With the outbox → single-relay pipeline, `audit_log` id order ≡
//! commit order, so a consumer that walks ids misses nothing — the
//! Q2/Q6 coupling the design doc records. This module is the
//! walking: `SELECT ... WHERE id > cursor ORDER BY id`, hand each
//! row to the transport-agnostic rules `handle`, advance the cursor
//! per settled row. The durable state is one row in
//! `dispatcher_log_cursor`; there is no ack ledger and no dedup
//! table because a crash re-runs at most the unsettled tail and
//! every handler is already idempotent (the at-least-once contract
//! this crate has held since the JetStream era).
//!
//! ## Retry without NAK
//!
//! Ordered delivery has no redelivery queue: a failing row BLOCKS the
//! cursor and is re-presented on the next drain with an incremented
//! in-memory attempt count, paced by the same widening schedule the
//! JetStream consumers used. At [`MAX_ATTEMPTS`] the row is
//! dead-lettered — loudly, with the `DEAD-LETTER:` line the release
//! gates grep for — and the cursor advances past it: a poison event
//! delays the tail by its budget (~98s), never wedges it. Attempts
//! are in-memory by design: a process restart re-presents the row
//! with a fresh budget, which errs toward retrying — the safe side
//! for side effects that are idempotent.
//!
//! ## Sequencing note
//!
//! v1 is sequential where the JetStream loop fanned out 12-wide. The
//! measured rules volume is ~1 event/sec steady with bursts the
//! relay itself paces; if drain depth ever says otherwise, the
//! fan-out returns with a settled-prefix cursor advance. Named here
//! so the simplification is a decision, not an accident.
