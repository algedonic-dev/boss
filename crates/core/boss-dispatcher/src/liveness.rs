//! Live readiness of the dispatcher's two durable JetStream consumers — the
//! signal a `/api/dispatcher/health` 200 cannot give you.
//!
//! `boss-dispatcher` spawns both consumer loops detached: if either's message
//! stream ends — a NATS blip, or JetStream not ready at cold start under a
//! launcher with NO per-service restart (the docker `services-launcher.sh`
//! uses `wait -n`, unlike systemd which restarts a dead unit) — the loop just
//! logs and ends while the PROCESS stays up and health-green. With the
//! assignment consumer dead, ready Steps are never assigned, the workforce has
//! nothing to pull, and every Job stalls `open`: the exact "thousands of jobs
//! in flight, nothing reaching a terminal state" failure.
//!
//! This handle makes that visible at `/api/dispatcher/readyz` so an operator —
//! and the brewery sim's pre-Go readiness gate — can confirm both consumers are
//! actually bound and draining before trusting the stack with work.
