//! Static cascade metadata for the dispatcher-rules visualization.
//!
//! The rule registry declares the reactive layer as `trigger event → rule →
//! handler(s)`. To render the full *cascade* — the feedback loops that
//! make the state machine self-drive — the graph also needs two facts
//! that are not in the rule registry:
//!
//!   1. **What each handler causes to be emitted** downstream (by the
//!      API it calls). A loop closes wherever an emitted kind matches
//!      some rule's `on_event` (e.g. `inventory.parts.consume` emits
//!      `inventory.item.consumed`, which re-triggers `spawn-restock`).
//!   2. **The jobs-api / external consequences** that re-enter the rule
//!      set but are NOT dispatcher rules themselves (a new Job's steps
//!      becoming ready; a completed step emitting its `done` topic; an
//!      invoice later being paid by a counterparty). Rendered distinctly
//!      so dispatcher rules stay visually separable from system/external
//!      wiring.
//!
//! Both are authored here — a documented, central "what each side-effect
//! causes" — and served by `GET /api/dispatcher/rules`. Kept in sync
//! with the handlers in `rules::handlers::*`;
//! `cascade_handlers_match_rules` (tests) guards against a rule
//! referencing a handler this map forgot, reading the authored registry
//! directory that IS the rule definition.
//!
//! THIS IS NOT THE RULE REGISTRY'S SECOND COPY, and the question was
//! settled when the registry collapsed to one home (backlog 41ba00cd).
//! The note that used to stand here said the `dispatcher_rules`-registry
//! migration "will fold this into first-class rule/handler metadata". It
//! will not, because the fact is a different one: a rule row says which
//! handler it invokes, and this map says what that HANDLER emits, which
//! is a property of the handler's Rust and of nothing a rule author
//! writes. Moving it onto the rule row would make every rule naming the
//! same handler restate it — CLAUDE.md §9a's duplication, created rather
//! than removed. So it stays one declaration, in the crate whose code it
//! describes, pinned to the rule registry by the guard below.
