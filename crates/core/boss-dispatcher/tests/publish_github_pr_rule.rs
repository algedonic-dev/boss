//! The `publish-github-pr-on-open-pr-ready` rule (first seeded by
//! migration 202609081200, now its file under `infra/dispatcher/rules/`)
//! — the machine half of `publish-to-github` v6.
//!
//! When the protocol's `open-pr` step becomes READY (David approved
//! the publish), the dispatcher spawns an ops-request for host=forge
//! verb=publish-github-pr; the root ops-runner on the forge runs the
//! verb, which builds the snapshot commit, pushes it to the dauld fork
//! and opens the PR, then completes `open-pr` with `pr_url`.
//!
//! Routing rides on the STEP's metadata, not its slug: `step.ready.*`
//! payloads carry `metadata` (the step's `metadata_defaults`, stamped
//! at materialization) and do NOT hoist `spec_slug` the way
//! `step.done.*` does. So the bundle stamps `ops_verb =
//! "publish-github-pr"` on the open-pr step, and the rule's `when`
//! reads `metadata.ops_verb`. A step without the marker resolves to
//! Absent, which is UNEQUAL to the literal — the predicate reads
//! false, not PredicateFailed — so every other `task` step on the
//! shared topic is skipped cleanly rather than dead-lettered.
