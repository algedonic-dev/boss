//! The sweep and the edge must spawn the SAME review.
//!
//! `design-review-spawn` (migration 107) reacts to
//! `docs.design.indexed`; `design-review-level-sweep` (141) asks the
//! same question on a daily schedule, because a level question asked
//! only on an edge cannot notice a review that was closed while its
//! doc still had open questions — which is how roughly twenty-three
//! questions became unreachable on 2026-08-13 (ae8a14f7).
//!
//! `docs.design.sweep` deliberately owns no spawn spec: it decides
//! WHICH docs are orphaned and hands each to `jobs.spawn` as the
//! payload the edge would have delivered. That keeps the shape of a
//! review in registry rows rather than handler code — and it means the
//! two rows now carry the same args, which is a fact living twice
//! (CLAUDE.md §9a). Collapsing it is not available: they are separate
//! registry rows by design, one event-triggered and one clock-
//! triggered. So it gets the test §9a prescribes instead, and the test
//! names the offending key when they drift.
//!
//! The failure this prevents is quiet. Change 107's args — a new
//! metadata field, a different subject_kind — and the edge keeps
//! spawning correct reviews while the sweep spawns subtly wrong ones,
//! visible only as two lineages of the same Job kind on the board.
