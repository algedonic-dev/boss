//! A rule row a migration inserted and no file ever authored again is
//! SEED RESIDUE, not history — and a fresh database no longer carries it.
//!
//! WHAT WAS MEASURED (backlog b5f21e82, 2026-09-18). Thirty-one
//! `INSERT INTO dispatcher_rules` migrations under `infra/postgres/schema/`
//! predate the collapse that made `infra/dispatcher/rules/` the
//! registry's definition (41ba00cd, 2026-09-11). They are applied
//! history and stay exactly as written, so on EVERY fresh database they
//! still insert sixty-four rule names as active product rows. Thirty-five
//! of those names no product file authors any longer: the thirty-one
//! brewery reactors moved to `examples/brewery/seeds/rules.toml` on
//! 2026-09-17 (design e2580840 car 4, backlog 105fb702) and four the
//! design-doc corpus indexer's deletion retired (f5da586c). The boot
//! seed then retired all thirty-five, on every new instance — churn in
//! every first boot log, retired history a tenant's `boss tenant
//! publish` had to TAKE OVER (70bc5725: its row lands at v(n+1), above
//! a version its file never named), and a permanent `registry ahead,
//! left alone` line per rule on every publish after that.
//!
//! The migration under test deletes those rows: a static list of names
//! derived from the tree, `source IS NULL` only, and only where no
//! tenant-sourced row holds the name (a tenant that already took a name
//! over keeps the history its takeover was judged against). Applied
//! after the inserts on a fresh database, it undoes them before the seed
//! runs, so the seed retires nothing and a tenant lands at its file's
//! version; on a converged database the rows are the retired residue,
//! and they go.
//!
//! THE PIN (CLAUDE.md §9a). The list in the migration is a copy of a
//! fact the tree holds — names inserted by migrations minus names under
//! `infra/dispatcher/rules/` — and a copy is pinned. Both directions:
//! every name listed is one a migration inserted and no product file
//! authors; every such name is listed.
