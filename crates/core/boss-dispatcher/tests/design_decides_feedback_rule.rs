//! Deciding the design decides the feedback (backlog 5f0b2661): the
//! rule row `complete-feedback-design-review-on-design-doc-published`,
//! at the layer it is implemented in — one rule over the generic
//! `jobs.complete_linked_step` handler, read from the directory the
//! dispatcher boots from (`common::shipped_registry`).
//!
//! THE DEFECT. A feedback routed to `design` gave one person TWO
//! decisions: the design-doc's review (structured questions at
//! /it/design) and the feedback's own `design-review` step, an
//! `answer-question` with no question. The design IS the question, so
//! the second rendered as a statement (David, bug 4f6019d7: "There is
//! no question, just a statement"), and the link between the two was
//! `metadata.design_packet`, a string nothing read. `boss design
//! --answers` now records an `answers` job edge on the design, and this
//! rule follows it when the design publishes.
//!
//! What only this layer can pin, and a handler unit test cannot:
//!
//! 1. The rule SELECTS off the close marker: a `published` design-doc
//!    fires it; a design closed any other way (a hand close carries a
//!    null outcome) does not; a merged car does not.
//! 2. The `link` it follows is a DECLARED `design-doc` job edge, not a
//!    prose field — the registry is what makes the id ref-checked.
//! 3. The step it completes is the LIVE `design-review` of BOTH kinds a
//!    design can be filed for — `user-feedback` and `backlog-item` —
//!    and the verdict it writes is a member of that step's live enum,
//!    with every field the `answer-question` kind requires at done.
//!    (This is also the answer to the packet's side question: backlog-
//!    item's design-review has the SAME gap, and the same rule covers
//!    it — the handler follows the edge to whatever kind it names.)
//! 4. The outcome the rule's `when` names IS the design-doc Workflow's
//!    terminal — rename it and the rule silently stops firing.
//!
//! THE MOMENT (backlog 8f83cade, 2026-09-18). `published` was one agent
//! step too late: between the review and the terminal sits `fold`, so
//! a design David had decided stayed undecided on the packet it
//! answers until the agent folded — two 'Decide the design' steps in
//! his queue after he had answered both designs. The same obligation
//! now fires at the review's completion
//! (`complete-feedback-design-review-on-design-review-decided`, on
//! `step.done.review-design`), and the published-time rule stays as
//! the backstop for a design decided before it was live. What this
//! layer pins for the review-time rule: (5) it selects the design-doc
//! Workflow's `review` step and nothing else on its topic — the legacy
//! `design-doc-review` protocol has a `review-design` step too, with no
//! `answers` edge to follow; and (3) applies to it unchanged, since
//! it completes the same live step with the same verdict.
