//! Every seeded rule must only reference fields its event declares.
//!
//! This is the gate cf7ae3b5 asked for: "turn today's dead-letter into a
//! 422 at authoring time". It runs against the SEEDED registry — the same
//! `dispatcher_rules` and `event_kinds` rows a deployment gets — so a
//! migration that adds a rule binding a field its topic does not carry
//! fails here rather than eight NAKs into production.
//!
//! It is a ratchet. A topic whose `payload_fields` roster is empty is not
//! checked, so this starts covering `jobs.job.closed` (migration 137, the
//! most-bound topic and the one that actually dead-lettered) and widens
//! one roster at a time. The second test below is what makes that honest:
//! it asserts at least one roster exists, so the whole file cannot quietly
//! degrade into a no-op if a migration ever empties the column.
