//! Every daily spawner asks before it spawns, and every guard it asks
//! with actually exists.
//!
//! 0517387b: the maintenance-sweep spawn rules fired unconditionally —
//! `schedule` + `jobs.spawn` and no `when` — so an obligation nobody
//! could discharge accumulated one packet per day (5 open
//! cluster-conformance sweeps when measured). The guard is rule DATA
//! (`NOT open_job_exists(kind, subject)`), which is exactly why a test
//! must pin it: nothing else connects a TOML `when` string to the Rust
//! helper it names, and a rule added without a guard regresses
//! silently. Both directions:
//!
//! 1. Every rule that spawns a `maintenance-sweep` carries a dedup
//!    guard naming its own subject — a new sweep rule without one
//!    fails here BY NAME.
//! 2. Every helper referenced by any `when` in the rule registry resolves in
//!    the one resolver the runners bind (`InventoryHelpers`). Called
//!    with empty args: a KNOWN helper refuses with a helper error, an
//!    unknown one is `UnknownHelper` — no HTTP happens either way, so
//!    the pin runs without a jobs-api.
