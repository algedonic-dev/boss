//! JetStream durability layer for the event bus.
//!
//! Plain core NATS is at-most-once: a message is delivered once and, if
//! the subscriber's handler fails, the work is simply lost. For the
//! dispatcher's consumers that meant a transient hiccup — a briefly
//! unreachable policy-api, a saturated Postgres — silently *orphaned* the
//! Job whose step-completion event got dropped.
//!
//! This module adds a durable delivery buffer on top of the same NATS
//! server. A JetStream stream ([`STREAM_NAME`]) captures the job/step
//! lifecycle subjects; the dispatcher binds **durable pull consumers**
//! ([`open_durable`]) that explicitly ACK on success and NAK on failure.
//! A NAK redelivers the message on a backoff schedule, so a transient
//! failure self-heals once the underlying condition clears, and only a
//! genuinely-unprocessable event (exhausting [`MAX_DELIVER`]) is dropped —
//! loudly, as a dead-letter.
//!
//! This is **not** a second system of record. The Postgres `audit_log`
//! remains authoritative; the stream is a bounded, expiring buffer whose
//! sole job is reliable in-flight delivery. Publishers keep using plain
//! core NATS (`EventBus::publish`) — JetStream captures any message
//! published to a subject the stream covers, so no publisher changes.
