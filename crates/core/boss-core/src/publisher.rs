//! Fire-and-forget domain event publisher + the [`EventStamp`]
//! envelope every outbox-recorded event is built from.
//!
//! **Record stamps are wall-clock.** Sim time is fully retired from
//! `Event.timestamp` / `audit_log.timestamp` (David, 2026-08-22,
//! packet a7a4cae5): a deployment whose clock-api runs in sim mode
//! still stamps every record with real time, so one incident's rows
//! read as one timeline. Sim time survives only as **payload data**
//! (business dates a handler reads from the clock port) and inside
//! the sim's own scheduling — never on the record. If a record ever
//! needs a sim-timeline annotation again, that returns as a protocol
//! field (explicitly deferred).
//!
//! The publisher wraps an `EventBus` and optionally an `AuditWriter`.
//! On error, returns false but never propagates — write operations
//! must not fail because the event bus or audit log is unavailable.
//!
//! "Never propagates" is NOT "silent": every bus or audit failure
//! logs at ERROR with the event identity. The audit log is the
//! system of record — a dropped write there means a state change
//! with no provenance, permanently unreproducible by
//! rebuild-from-log. The structural fix (audit insert joins the
//! domain transaction; the bus demotes to post-commit notification)
//! is tracked as its own workstream; this layer's job until then is
//! to make every hole loud the moment it is punched.
