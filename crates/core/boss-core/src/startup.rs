//! Boot-time helpers every BOSS service binary uses: the masked
//! database URL for logs, and the `/health` capability snapshot.
//!
//! THERE IS NO IN-MEMORY SERVING BRANCH. Until 2026-09-12 this module
//! carried `require_postgres_or_explicit_inmemory`, a guard for a
//! binary built without the `postgres` feature that would refuse to
//! serve from a process-local map unless `BOSS_ALLOW_INMEMORY=1` was
//! set. Measured (backlog be793304): nothing in the tree set that
//! variable, every service binary declares `required-features =
//! ["postgres"]` so cargo will not build one without the feature, and
//! infra/check-binary-build-coverage.sh classified REACHING the guard
//! as a defect. A branch whose sanctioned outcome is "never reached"
//! is not a safety net; it is code that cannot run. The thirteen
//! `cfg(not(feature = "postgres"))` arms that called it went with it,
//! and the two binaries that chose storage at RUNTIME from an optional
//! `postgres_url` (boss-jobs-api, boss-assets-api) now refuse to start
//! without one. The in-memory repositories themselves stay: they are
//! what the unit tests run against.
