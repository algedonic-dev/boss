//! Shared types for the Job coordination primitive.
//!
//! A Job is a bounded unit of coordinated work — device repair, procurement,
//! sales cycle, marketing campaign, employee onboarding. Jobs decompose into
//! Steps, each owned by a person or team, with optional sign-off gates
//! and cross-job dependency tracking.
//!
//! These types live in boss-core because they are shared vocabulary: every
//! domain crate can reference a JobId or Subject without depending on the
//! boss-jobs service crate.
