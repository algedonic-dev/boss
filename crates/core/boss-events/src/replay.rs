//! Shared TRUNCATE-replay skeleton for projection rebuilders.
//!
//! Every projection rebuilder shares the same control flow: open a
//! transaction, take the rebuild advisory lock, wipe the projection
//! tables, stream the matching `audit_log` rows in id order, fold each
//! through a domain-specific `apply` step, then commit. Only three
//! things actually vary between rebuilders — the lock key, the wipe
//! statements, and the event filter — plus the apply step itself,
//! which is the whole point. This module owns the invariant skeleton so
//! each rebuilder keeps only its genuinely per-projection parts.
//!
//! The skeleton is the place the five-property correctness protocol
//! cares about: one audited definition of "replay the log into a
//! projection" (one transaction, advisory-locked, audit-ordered) beats a
//! dozen copies that can drift apart. The apply step stays in the domain
//! crate, where the projection logic belongs.
