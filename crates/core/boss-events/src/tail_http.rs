//! Audit-log tail HTTP endpoint — the read surface for `audit_log`.
//!
//! Writers (every service's `PgAuditWriter`) insert rows; this router
//! serves recent-first reads with filters on source, kind, actor, and
//! time window. Intended home: the CTO surface at `/cto/events`, where an
//! operator can watch the event stream flow in ~real time.
//!
//! Access: Operator tier, Auditor tier, or role ∈ {ceo, cto}.
//! Everybody else gets 403. The log carries every domain payload
//! including HR + financial events, so it's locked down harder than a
//! domain-specific admin view. Role-based fallback exists so the CTO
//! can watch the tail from a normal session without needing a
//! FIDO-elevated cookie just to glance at the feed.
//!
//! This router lives in boss-events (not a domain crate) because the
//! audit_log is cross-cutting. It's mounted in `boss-people-api` for
//! convenience — people-api already owns the Postgres pool and the
//! admin-side routers. The gateway's `/api/events/{*rest}` proxy
//! points at people-api's port.
