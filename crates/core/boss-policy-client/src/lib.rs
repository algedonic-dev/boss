//! Client-side surface for boss-policy. Every domain service depends
//! on this crate and holds an `Arc<dyn PolicyClient>` in its HTTP
//! state. Tests plug in `FakePolicyClient`; prod plugs in
//! `ReqwestPolicyClient`.
//!
//! The contract types + the in-memory engine live HERE in the
//! *-client crate, not in `boss-policy`. The service crate
//! (`boss-policy`) contains just the HTTP server + Postgres adapter
//! + the seeder binaries. This keeps hexagonal-port hygiene:
//! consumers of `boss-policy-client` don't transitively pull
//! `boss-policy`'s sqlx + axum service-side dep tree.
//!
//! Caching: `ReqwestPolicyClient` keeps a 60s TTL cache keyed on
//! `(user_id, role, access_tier, action, resource)` — every input the
//! decision reads (backlog 8878f85f; see `CacheKey`). Invalidation is TTL-only; NATS-
//! driven invalidation on top of the TTL is a planned addition (D4).
//!
//! Fail-closed: if the HTTP call fails (no connection, a timeout, a
//! 5xx) and no live cache entry is available, `check` and
//! `scope_predicate` return `Err(PolicyClientError::Unreachable)` —
//! never an Allow (D9), and never cached. It is an ERROR rather than a
//! Deny so a door can answer it as what it is, a 503 with Retry-After
//! (`impl IntoResponse for PolicyClientError`), instead of a 403 or an
//! empty page (backlog 45553536). Only decisions the service made are
//! cached.
