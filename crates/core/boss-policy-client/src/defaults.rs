//! Default policy rules seeded at service startup.
//!
//! Core ships only the **platform-level** rules every BOSS deployment
//! needs to run:
//!
//! - `platform-admin` — the operator who owns the deployment. Broad
//!   Read across every shipped resource + Create/Update/Publish/
//!   Retire/Delete on the registry resources (`policy-rule`,
//!   `workflow`, `step-plugin`) that govern how the platform behaves.
//! - `audit-readonly` — the external-auditor / OSS-anonymous-visitor
//!   role. Strictly Read on every shipped resource.
//! - `smoke-tester` — fixture role for the boss-testing harness.
//!   Read-only mirror of `audit-readonly`; isolated so a misconfigured
//!   test can't accidentally drift external-auditor expectations.
//! - `guest` — the unauth landing surface. Strictly
//!   `workflow` Read; no other resource.
//!
//! Tenant role grants (sales-rep, service-tech, controllers, the
//! C-suite, department managers, …) live in **tenant seed data**, not
//! here. The 2026-05-24 tier-purity pass moved the prior ~365-line
//! used-device-shop org chart out of core — it was wrong on every
//! non-device-shop deployment (e.g. the brewery's role set never got
//! these grants), and it tied core's release cadence to one tenant's
//! HR model. Tenants seed their role matrix at first boot via the
//! `boss-policy-bootstrap` binary, which reads
//! `examples/<tenant>/seeds/policy_rules.toml` and POSTs each rule
//! to `/api/policy/rules`. See [`crate::seed_loader`] for the TOML
//! schema.
//!
//! Operators can edit any rule via the admin API and their changes
//! survive restarts: `bootstrap_reconcile` only refreshes rows whose
//! `updated_by = 'bootstrap'`. Operator-tuned rows are preserved.

    //   wedged train. (The kube-apiserver half of this lever is the
    //   PIV applet on the same key — outside BOSS policy by design.)
    // - **Merge approval** → SignOff on `step-signoff:platform-admin`:
    //   the platform-authority stamp an emergency merge-approval step
    //   requires. Honestly noted: this is the nearest real resource
    //   and is wider than merge-only — it satisfies ANY step whose
    //   sign-off names platform-admin authority. There is no
    //   narrower merge-approval resource today; minting a dead
    //   `step-signoff:break-glass` no workflow requires would grant
    //   nothing.
    // - **Auth administration** → Create/Update on `policy-rule`:
    //   repair a broken grant that caused the lockout. The gateway-
    //   side half (onboard credentials, issue resets) is
    //   `boss_core::roles::can_administer_auth`, which names this
    //   role explicitly.
    //
    // Reads are the working set for those three verbs and nothing
    // more: job/step (the packets being driven), workflow (what the
    // packets instantiate), event (the audit trail during an
    // incident), policy-rule (what auth administration edits). No
    // ledger, no accounts, no employees — an emergency key is a door
