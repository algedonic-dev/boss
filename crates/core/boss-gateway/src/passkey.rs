//! The passkey ceremony — BOSS-native WebAuthn for presence assurance.
//!
//! Design: docs/design/presence.md (Q1-Q3 resolved 2026-08-16) and the
//! BOSS-native call accepted on packet 7218c3f1: enrolment happens
//! behind an already-authenticated session, assertions verify against
//! a BOSS-issued challenge bound to the step's shape hash, credentials
//! live in a BOSS table (boss-people's `webauthn_credentials`), and
//! Kanidm stays login-only — delegating the ceremony to it would lose
//! per-step challenge binding.
//!
//! Q2's decision, honored literally: the challenge IS the shape hash,
//! with the replay caveat resolved exactly as recorded:
//! `challenge = sha256(shape_hash || ":" || nonce)`.
//!
//! The passkey signature is itself the binding: an assertion cannot be
//! replayed against a different step (different hash → different
//! challenge), nor against the same step after an edit (the hash
//! moved), nor twice (the nonce'd challenge row is single-use).
//!
//! Split of labor: this module runs the cryptographic ceremony against
//! the browser (webauthn-rs; the custom-challenge state is built
//! through the crate's own serde, so every verification step stays in
//! the library). boss-people stores credentials and the single-use
//! challenge ledger. boss-jobs consumes the OUTCOME: a verified
//! assertion becomes a short-lived HMAC ticket (`x-presence-ticket`),
//! which the role_headers middleware — after stripping every inbound
//! `x-boss-*` so a client cannot forge it — verifies and forwards, still
//! signed, as `x-boss-presence`. The jobs API verifies that signature
//! AGAIN before it reads `produced = Presence`, because its machine door
//! is reachable without this gateway (backlog 72fe3640); the ticket type
//! and its check are `boss_core::presence`, one definition for both. No
//! fallback path exists anywhere in the chain, per Q3: an assurance
//! level with a bypass is a comment, not a control.
