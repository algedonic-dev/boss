//! Break-glass — the emergency door is a hardware key you hold.
//!
//! Design: docs/design/break-glass-is-a-key-you-hold.md, Q1-Q6
//! resolved on packet e9703d8f (2026-09-03). The gateway is the
//! break-glass *verifier*: a minimal WebAuthn relying party whose
//! whole credential store is public material in an in-tree ConfigMap
//! (`infra/cluster/manifests/boss-break-glass-credentials.yaml`).
//! A verified assertion mints a `boss_session` carrying the NARROW
//! `break-glass` role (Q4) — deploy rollback, merge approval, auth
//! administration; never platform-admin.
//!
//! What each resolved question shaped here:
//!
//! - **Q1 — any attested roaming authenticator.** Registration asks
//!   the browser for `attestation: "direct"` and the finish handler
//!   refuses any credential whose verified attestation is not a
//!   certificate-chain form (`Basic` / `AttCa` / `AnonCa`). No AAGUID
//!   allowlist. Honesty about the limit: webauthn-rs verifies the
//!   attestation *statement* (signature over authData + clientData,
//!   per format), but without a curated FIDO-MDS root store the chain
//!   is not pinned to known vendor roots — a sophisticated attacker
//!   could self-sign a plausible chain. What the check DOES exclude
//!   is every real synced-passkey provider (iCloud Keychain, Google
//!   Password Manager, browser-software keys), which attest `none`,
//!   and any credential flagged backup-eligible (the BE flag every
//!   synced passkey sets). Device-bound is enforced as far as the
//!   crate allows; the residual gap is documented, not papered over.
//! - **Q2 — both keys enrolled upfront.** Two records, labels
//!   `primary` and `backup`, either sufficient to assert.
//! - **Q3 — browser ceremony only.** The self-contained ceremony page
//!   at `/break-glass` is served from a constant in this binary — no
//!   SPA bundle, no upstream service, nothing that can be down when
//!   the gateway itself is up. Terminal cases are covered by the PIV
//!   and sk-SSH applets on the same physical key, outside this module.
//! - **Q5 — credential records in an in-tree ConfigMap.** Public keys
//!   are public. Enrollment does NOT write the ConfigMap: an
//!   imperative patch to a converge-managed object is a change with
//!   an expiry (the converge loop reapplies the in-tree manifest and
//!   would silently erase enrolled keys). Instead the finish handler
//!   EMITS the complete record — response body and log line — and the
//!   operator commits it to the manifest; the kubelet propagates the
//!   ConfigMap update into the mount without a restart, and this
//!   module re-reads the directory on every ceremony. The tree stays
//!   the source of truth, which is the entire point of Q5.
//! - **Q6 — one train of soak.** `credentials.toml` and
//!   `POST /api/auth/login` are untouched; this RP lands alongside
//!   them. The PVC retirement is the follow-up car after prod proof.
//!
//! Enrollment gating: ONLY an already-authenticated break-glass
//! session (key rotation, adding the backup later) or the bootstrap
//! window — a `BOSS_BREAK_GLASS_ENROLL_TOKEN` match while ZERO
//! credentials are enrolled. The window closes by itself the moment
//! the first record lands in the ConfigMap, and does not exist at all
//! when the env var is unset.
//!
//! Sign counters, honestly: the durable counter is the `sign_count`
//! committed in the ConfigMap; this process keeps a monotonic
//! in-memory high-water mark on top of it, and webauthn-rs rejects
//! any assertion whose counter does not advance past the value the
//! credential carried at challenge time. Within a process lifetime
//! clone detection is therefore real; across a gateway restart the
//! floor falls back to the committed value, so a clone used only
//! between restarts could evade it until the operator refreshes
//! `sign_count` in the manifest (each successful assertion logs the
//! new value for exactly that purpose).
//!
//! Pending ceremony state lives in-process (single-use, five-minute
//! TTL). Deliberate: the break-glass verifier must not depend on any
//! other service being alive — the design's whole table of levers is
//! about which verifiers survive which outages — and the gateway
//! deploys single-replica (`strategy: Recreate`), so there is no
//! second instance for a ceremony to land on.
