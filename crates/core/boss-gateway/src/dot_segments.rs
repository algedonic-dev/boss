//! No path reaches a route with a `.` or `..` segment in it (backlog
//! 1d9b7db7, 2026-09-25).
//!
//! WHY. The route table is an allowlist only if the path a route
//! matched is the path its upstream receives, and it was not. axum
//! matches on the raw, still-percent-encoded path, so `/ics/%2e%2e/x`
//! matches `/ics/{*rest}`; the proxy then hands `{upstream}{path}` to
//! reqwest, whose URL parser (url 2.5.8, parser.rs) resolves `..`,
//! `%2e%2e` in every case mix, `.%2e` and `%2e.` as a parent segment and
//! `.` / `%2e` as a current one — BEFORE the request leaves the gateway.
//! The host and port stay the route's; the path moves anywhere on that
//! upstream. Measured by the triage of this item on origin/main
//! 9df57797:
//!
//! - `/ics/{*rest}` is sessionless on EVERY instance and proxies to the
//!   jobs upstream, so `GET /ics/%2e%2e/api/<anything>` reached
//!   boss-jobs-api with no session at all;
//! - `/api/workflows/{*rest}`, where a tenant declares it public (the
//!   public demo tenant does), is the same door;
//! - for a session holder, `/api/<svc>/%2e%2e/<path>` reached paths on
//!   that upstream the gateway never routes — the table stopped being
//!   an allowlist.
//!
//! The URL standard also treats `\` as a path separator for http, and
//! the `http` crate accepts a raw `\` in a request target (uri/path.rs
//! admits 0x40..=0x5F), so `/ics/..\api/jobs` is the same traversal
//! spelled with a backslash; this module splits on both.
//!
//! The file handlers do not lean on this. The static SPA handler
//! (static_files.rs) once joined the raw path onto its directory and
//! checked `Path::starts_with`, which is lexical, so a raw `..` passed
//! and the OS resolved it; since backlog 814a32a2 it resolves only
//! plain-name components and reads a file only if its canonical path
//! sits inside the canonical directory, and the `/plugins/` handler
//! (plugin_files.rs) reads through the same two walls (backlog
//! a77ac150). This edge is the outer line in front of them, not their
//! only one.
//!
//! WHAT IS REFUSED. A segment — between `/` or `\` separators — that
//! reads `.` or `..` once `%2e` (either case) is read as a dot: exactly
//! the set the URL parser collapses, so nothing it would move is let
//! through and nothing it leaves alone is refused. `calendar.ics`,
//! `app.js`, `v1.2`, `..hidden` and `...` are names, not dot segments,
//! and pass. A browser never sends a dot segment (it resolves them
//! before the request), so the only senders of one are hand-built
//! requests, which get a 400 naming why.
//!
//! WHERE. Outermost, and around the router rather than inside it:
//! [`mount`] wraps the whole finished router — site, inquiry door,
//! role headers, every route and the fallback — as the ONE service a
//! request enters, so no matcher, no handler and no other layer sees a
//! refused path.
