//! The gateway joins the log — auth events for the edge
//! (Q1+Q2 resolved 2026-08-11; folded into
//! docs/architecture-decisions.md §Policy & auth).
//!
//! Q1: the gateway stages events on the transactional outbox through
//! its own small pool (recipe 3 of transactional-audit-log.md — the
//! record-only shape, `PgOutboxRecorder`), because a session is a
//! cookie, not a row: there is no domain write for the event to join,
//! and what the pool buys is membership in the one pipeline — durable
//! staging, relay ordering, replay, the ref-check trigger — not
//! atomicity. The connection is expected to run as an INSERT-only
//! Postgres role (111-gateway-audit-events.sql); the internet-facing
//! edge gets the least privilege that can stage an event.
//!
//! Q2: three kinds, registered in `event_kinds` with source
//! `gateway`. `auth.login.denied` carries a closed reason and NO
//! subject reference — no employee matched, and asserting one would
//! both lie and trip the ref-check. IdP *transport* failures
//! (discovery down, token exchange) are not auth decisions and stay
//! plain warn lines in the handlers. A Class registry that cannot
//! confirm a verified employee's role IS one: the person proved who
//! they are and is refused a session because of it, so that 503 is
//! `reason: role_unconfirmed` (backlog 8f45e0b4). `auth.login.succeeded`
//! carries the method so the imminent passkey path lands as an enum
//! value, not a schema change, and a `downgrade: {from, to}` when the
//! session carries less than the employee row asked for.
//! `auth.session.guest` counts mints of the unauthenticated read-only
//! capability.
//!
//! The auth-admin doors joined later (backlog 17ae5248, 2026-09-25):
//! `auth.credential.written` (onboard: created or overwritten) and
//! `auth.reset.issued` (issue-reset), each naming the target email and
//! the acting session — never a password or a token.
//!
//! Failure posture (the LogTransport principle): emitting never
//! blocks and never fails a login. The handler hands the event to a
//! bounded channel; a background task stages it. Channel full,
//! channel gone, no pool configured, or the INSERT failing all
//! degrade to the structured `tracing::warn!` that was the record
//! before this module existed — never to silence.
//!
//! Timestamps are wall-clock, minted at staging time — sim time is
//! retired from the record (David, 2026-08-22, packet a7a4cae5), and
//! an auth decision is real-world activity in any clock mode. The
//! handler never awaits anything to stamp.
