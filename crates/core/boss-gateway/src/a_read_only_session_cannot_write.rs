//! A read-only session cannot write through the gateway (backlog
//! 07e797b4, 2026-09-25).
//!
//! The blast-radius sweep of car e2209174 found about 110 write routes
//! across the core and module services that authorize no caller —
//! dispatcher rule publish/retire, `POST /api/jobs`, the scheduling
//! calendar token, ~27 ledger writes, messages without ownership — and
//! every one of them was one proxied request away from ANY valid
//! session, including the anonymous one `POST /api/auth/guest` mints.
//! Since design 2830b6b7 that guest carries one of TWO roles — the
//! basic `visitor` (the OSS default) or `audit-readonly` (an instance's
//! opt-in to the system-audit read) — so every guest test here runs
//! once per minting mode. The edge is the one place every one of
//! them passes, so the class closes there: a read-only session may send
//! GET, HEAD and OPTIONS, and every other method is refused with a named
//! 403 before any upstream is contacted. Per-service authorization
//! follows as its own items; this is the floor under them.
//!
//! THE STUB IS THE UPSTREAM FOR EVERY ROUTE. The gateway's HTTP client
//! is built here with a forward proxy pointing at a recording stub, so
//! every request the gateway would send to ANY service lands on the stub
//! instead — whatever upstream URL a `ProxyConfig` resolves to. That is
//! what makes "before any upstream is contacted" something a test can
//! count, and it is also the safety property: no request in this module
//! can reach a real service on a loopback port (a port-forward on the
//! pod makes one production — CLAUDE.md), not even a write the edge
//! failed to refuse, which is exactly the case the red run exercises.
//!
//! THE ROUTE LIST IS READ, NOT REMEMBERED. Every proxied route is taken
//! from `main.rs`'s own text — the line after a matcher that names
//! `proxy::handle` or `proxy::handle_app` — plus the `public_reads`
//! family, whose write methods chain through the same gated proxy. A
//! route added next week is swept by this test the day it lands.
