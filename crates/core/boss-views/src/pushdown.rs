//! Splitting a filter into "what SQL can answer" and a residual.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! Pushdown is an **optimization and only an optimization**. Whatever
//! SQL returns, the full original predicate is re-evaluated against
//! every row in-process before it reaches the caller. So the emitted
//! condition must be **implied by** the filter — a superset the
//! residual then trims. Never a subset, and never something the
//! database refuses to run.
//!
//! - An extractor that finds nothing is correct, just slow.
//! - An extractor that finds a term is correct, just faster.
//! - An extractor that finds a term *wrongly* is the only way to be
//!   wrong. Two ways to get that wrong, both learned the hard way:
//!   emitting a **narrower** condition than the filter (rows vanish
//!   with no way to recover them), or emitting one Postgres **refuses
//!   to type** (the request 500s instead of answering).
//!
//! # Why AND and OR differ
//!
//! Under AND, dropping a branch widens: `A` alone returns a superset
//! of `A AND B`, and the residual trims it. So a conjunct pushes down
//! whether or not its sibling does.
//!
//! Under OR, dropping a branch *narrows* — rows satisfying only the
//! dropped branch are lost, and the residual cannot get them back
//! because SQL never returned them. So a disjunction pushes down only
//! if **every** branch does. Approximating the unexpressible branch as
//! TRUE is sound but collapses the whole OR to TRUE, which is the same
//! as pushing nothing.
//!
//! That asymmetry is the entire subtlety here, and it is why
//! [`Pushdown::Or`] is built only from a complete set of branches.
//!
//! # Why range bounds are pushed *loose*
//!
//! `occurred_at` is a real timestamp in SQL, but the residual compares
//! the row's **rendered RFC3339 string** lexicographically, because
//! that is what the JSON row carries. Those two orderings agree for
//! well-formed same-offset timestamps and diverge at the edges — an
//! unpadded month (`2026-1-05`), a literal that is a prefix of the
//! rendered value (`2026-08-05` against
//! `2026-08-05T00:00:00+00:00`), a differing offset.
//!
//! The relaxation is **inclusivity only**: `>` is pushed as `>=` and
//! `<` as `<=`, at the exact parsed instant. That is enough, because
//! the row side is always padded RFC3339 (`to_rfc3339` on a UTC
//! instant), and lexicographic order on padded ISO-8601 IS
//! chronological order. A malformed literal — an unpadded month like
//! `2025-4-01` — makes the *residual* the stricter of the two, which
//! is the safe direction: SQL returns rows, the residual drops them.
//!
//! An earlier version also widened the bound by a day, on the theory
//! that more slack is safer. It was not. The scan is
//! `ORDER BY audit_id DESC LIMIT n`, so widening the window moves the
//! rows the limit keeps: a one-day query became a three-day window
//! whose newest `n` rows were **entirely outside the day asked for**,
//! and a filter matching 5,525 events answered 0. Slack is not free
//! when a LIMIT sits on top of it — the bound must be as tight as
//! soundness allows, not as loose as it can get away with.
//!
//! A literal that does not parse as a date or timestamp is not pushed
//! at all — `occurred_at > "banana"` would make Postgres reject the
//! statement, which is the 500 class again.
//!
//! # Why NOT is never pushed
//!
//! Negation inverts the direction of approximation: if `A'` is a
//! superset of `A`, then `NOT A'` is a *subset* of `NOT A`. Pushing a
//! negated term is therefore sound only when the inner condition is
//! **exact**, and this extractor cannot promise exactness — the
//! in-process evaluator has its own semantics for missing fields and
//! type mismatches that need not agree with SQL's for every value. So
//! `NOT` stops the walk. Widening this needs an exactness proof, not
//! just a new match arm.
