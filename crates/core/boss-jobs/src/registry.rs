//! Job Kind Registry — see docs/architecture-decisions.md §Jobs,
//! Workflows, Steps.
//!
//! Every Job is an instance of a Workflow. This module defines the
//! registry shape (`WorkflowSpec`), the port every adapter implements
//! (`WorkflowRegistry`), and the in-memory + postgres adapters.
//!
//! The registry is append-only: every edit to a kind creates a new
//! `(kind, version+1)` row. Only one row per `kind` has
//! `status = Active` at a time, enforced by a partial unique index
//! on the Postgres side and by an invariant in the in-memory adapter.

/// So the first step is a human declaring what this change contains
/// and what it deliberately leaves out, BEFORE the work. `excludes` is

/// the act that keeps a change small, and a field nobody has to fill
/// in would be filled in never. It is the split point, made a state

///   2. `gate`    — everything green, and observed working
///   3. `review`  — opened for review, url recorded
///   999. `merged`/`abandoned` — outcomes
// Kept only as the fidelity test's expected value — see
// `the_platform_bundle_matches_the_specs_it_replaced`. Out of
// `platform_workflows()`, so the lib build has no caller: the kind
// now lives in infra/platform/workflows/ and an operator edit

///
/// - `artifacts` exists because five separate stale-binary incidents
///   happened that day — a library built instead of a binary, a
///   binary that survived two build attempts, one copied over itself,
///   seventeen seed binaries that would have written the old schema
///   into the new database, and one whose mtime was NEWER than the
///   source change it was missing. Verifying artifacts is the step
///   everyone skips because the build said "Finished".
/// - `reset.destroying` is required because "clean start" should be a
///   decision recorded with the numbers, not a shrug. Say what is
///   being destroyed before destroying it.
/// - `backfill.went_live` is required because the transition is the
///   load-bearing claim of the whole design, and the temptation is to
///   assert it from a clean compile. It is confirmed by warp reaching
///   1.0 on a running clock or it is not confirmed.
/// - `verify.checks` is required because a sweep can pass vacuously —
///   the ledger replay-check went green that day on data that no
///   longer contained the case it had been failing on.
///
/// Step graph:
///  -1. `requested` — someone asked for a regen
///   0. `scope`     — why, and what it destroys (human-gated)
///   1. `build`     — release artifacts
///   2. `artifacts` — prove the built thing is the deployed thing
///   3. `deploy`    — install, including the non-service binaries
///   4. `reset`     — the destructive step (human-gated)
///   5. `backfill`  — synthetic past, then the go-live transition
///   6. `verify`    — schema, registry, invariants
///   999. `complete` / `abandoned`
