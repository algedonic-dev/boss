//! Job Kind Registry — see docs/architecture-decisions.md §Jobs,
//! Workflows, Steps.
//!
//! Every Job is an instance of a Workflow. This module defines the
//! registry shape (`WorkflowSpec`), the port every adapter implements
//! (`WorkflowRegistry`), and the in-memory + postgres adapters.
//!
//! The registry is append-only: every edit to a kind creates a new
//! `(kind, version+1)` row. Only one row per `kind` has
//! `status = Active` at a time, enforced by a partial unique index
//! on the Postgres side and by an invariant in the in-memory adapter.

/// owner, a recorded decision about its boundary, and a place in the
/// same throughput view as everything else the team does. `/system/flow`
/// counts these against a cadence target without a second mechanism.
///
/// The Subject is a `custom` Subject whose id is the branch name, the

/// history rather than from a report someone writes.

///
/// The problem this kind exists to solve is that a PR's boundary gets
/// decided at the END, when whoever is working is tired and everything
/// is already entangled. The branch that added this spec is the
/// evidence: one PR carrying a guest sign-in, a dispatcher fix, a
/// ledger determinism fix and two new surfaces, because nothing ever
/// asked where it should have been cut.
///
/// So the first step is a human declaring what this change contains
/// and what it deliberately leaves out, BEFORE the work. `excludes` is
/// required for exactly that reason: naming what you are not doing is
/// the act that keeps a change small, and a field nobody has to fill
/// in would be filled in never. It is the split point, made a state
/// transition instead of a judgement call.
///
/// Step graph:
///  -1. `opened`  — someone started a change
///   0. `scope`   — declare the boundary (human-gated)
///   1. `build`   — the change, with the test that fails without it
///   2. `gate`    — everything green, and observed working
///   3. `review`  — opened for review, url recorded
///   999. `merged`/`abandoned` — outcomes
// Kept only as the fidelity test's expected value — see
// `the_platform_bundle_matches_the_specs_it_replaced`. Out of
// `platform_workflows()`, so the lib build has no caller: the kind
// now lives in infra/platform/workflows.toml and an operator edit
// to it survives a boot, which is the whole point of the move.

/// - `artifacts` exists because five separate stale-binary incidents
///   happened that day — a library built instead of a binary, a
///   binary that survived two build attempts, one copied over itself,
///   seventeen seed binaries that would have written the old schema
///   into the new database, and one whose mtime was NEWER than the
///   source change it was missing. Verifying artifacts is the step
///   everyone skips because the build said "Finished".
/// - `reset.destroying` is required because "clean start" should be a
///   decision recorded with the numbers, not a shrug. Say what is
///   being destroyed before destroying it.
/// - `backfill.went_live` is required because the transition is the
///   load-bearing claim of the whole design, and the temptation is to
///   assert it from a clean compile. It is confirmed by warp reaching
///   1.0 on a running clock or it is not confirmed.
/// - `verify.checks` is required because a sweep can pass vacuously —
///   the ledger replay-check went green that day on data that no
///   longer contained the case it had been failing on.
///
/// Step graph:
///  -1. `requested` — someone asked for a regen
///   0. `scope`     — why, and what it destroys (human-gated)
///   1. `build`     — release artifacts
///   2. `artifacts` — prove the built thing is the deployed thing
///   3. `deploy`    — install, including the non-service binaries
///   4. `reset`     — the destructive step (human-gated)

/// Engineering backlog, modelled as work rather than as a markdown
/// file. TODO.md carried 41 open items across eight sections when this

/// you which of them are still true.
///
/// The Subject is the AREA the item touches — a `custom` Subject whose
/// id is a crate or surface path (`/crate/boss-ledger`,
/// `/surface/cockpit`). That makes "what is outstanding against the
/// ledger" a Subject-history question rather than a grep.
///
/// ## Why this is not `user-feedback` with a different name
///
/// The shape is close — both fork on a disposition — but two of the
/// routes here do not exist there, and they are the ones a backlog
/// needs most:
///
/// - `stale`: the claim is no longer true, and nobody did it on
///   purpose. Triaging this file found C1 ("event_facts and
///   search_index have no refresh path") dead — two timers now
///   refresh both, shipped by work that never referenced the item.
///   Feedback does not rot this way; an outside report is about
///   something that happened. An internal claim about the codebase
///   decays every time the codebase moves, which is daily.
/// - `verify`: the claim needs re-measuring before anyone acts. The
///   same triage hit an item whose RATIONALE was stale ("masked
///   because the gate only diffs journal lines" — it diffs facts now)
///   while its DEFECT stood unverified. Those are different states
///   and collapsing them is how a backlog becomes fiction.
///
/// ## Why `evidence` is required at triage
///
/// Because the failure mode of a backlog is not neglect, it is
/// confident wrong answers read off the file. Both findings above
/// came from checking the claim against the running system — one
/// item died, one survived, and reading either off its own text
/// would have got it backwards. You cannot route an item here
/// without saying what you actually checked.
///
/// Step graph:
///  -1. `filed`   — an item entered the backlog

/// The Subject is the surface the feedback is ABOUT — a `custom`

/// the event linkage work already answers.
///

///   999. `outcome` — closed

    // Triage is a FORK, not a checkbox. Its output is a decision about

    // route". The first cut of this spec had a single successor, which
    // made triage a step whose only possible outcome was closure; the
    // board built on it was a to-do list wearing a Kanban.
    //
    // The vocabulary is an INLINE field on the step rather than a new
    // StepType. `task`'s bundle stays generic and this Workflow carries
    // its own completion contract, which is what inline authoring is
    // for. The viability lint reads the pipe-shaped `field_type` as an
    // enum domain and proves every value has a successor, so a
    // disposition with nowhere to go fails at authoring time instead
    // of stranding a Job at runtime.

    // ROUTING IS NOT A ONE-SHOT GUESS (a001c78a, found by exercising

    // Every branch predicate used to read `steps.triage.metadata
    // .disposition` and nothing else, so the packet was routed exactly
    // once — before the investigation that produces the evidence. An

    // no move: recording that on the investigate step was decorative,

    // investigation ended the packet whatever it concluded. Observed
    // live on 3f5f7f63, whose recommendation is stranded on a closed
    // packet.
    //
    // So `investigate` carries the same vocabulary triage does, minus
    // `reproduce` (it IS the reproduction) and plus `resolved` (the
    // investigation settled it, which is v9's only behaviour). A branch
    // is reachable from whichever step reached that conclusion.
