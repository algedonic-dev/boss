//! Boot-time quarantine of unviable ACTIVE stations — the station
//! counterpart to [`crate::workflow_quarantine`].
//!
//! [`crate::station_lint::gate_active`] makes this pass rare by
//! construction: no API path can set an unviable row active. Quarantine
//! exists for the paths that never touch publish — rows INSERTed by the
//! SQL seeds (`116-stations.sql` and friends), rows that predate the
//! gate, and rows edited directly in the database.
//!
//! **Why retiring is safe here, and why this is simpler than the
//! Workflow pass.** A Workflow row cannot be auto-retired when open Jobs
//! are pinned to it — retiring would strand live work, so that case
//! refuses to start. Stations have no such case *by construction*:
//! membership is DERIVED, evaluated from the predicate at read time
//! against open Jobs, with no station field on the packet
//! (`116-stations.sql`). Nothing is ever pinned to a station version, so
//! retiring one strands nothing. There is no refuse-to-start path in
//! this file at all.
//!
//! **Why retire rather than leave it live.** Every rule the lint
//! enforces describes a queue that is either permanently empty or actively
//! misleading — an `actor` row that never binds `@me` shows every
//! executor the same list while claiming to be personal. An absent
//! queue is a question an operator asks; a wrong queue is one they
//! trust. The marker event carries the problems, and `upstream` gives
//! them somewhere to look.
