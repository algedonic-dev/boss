//! The IT system map's regions — `GET /api/yard/regions` (design
//! 0524fc95, decided 2026-09-19; this is car 1, the server read).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The Train Yard's KPIs were computed on the client:
//! `apps/web/src/it/yard/yard.ts` read six endpoints and derived every
//! number the page showed, and `boss orient` derived the same numbers
//! again, separately, on the CLI — two definitions of "trains in
//! transit", "time at CI", "dock depth", with nothing holding them
//! equal (a surface may answer differently than its server). A map that
//! bubbles KPIs up needs ONE definition per number. This module is it:
//! a pure function over rows the handler reads, answering a list of
//! REGIONS — dock, gates, track, shed, arrivals, garage, receiving,
//! marshalling — each with a `count` (what is here), a `state`
//! (clear / busy / troubled, from the thresholds the yard and the
//! alarms already use) and a `trend` (this window versus the previous).
//!
//! THE JUDGEMENTS ARE THE YARD'S OWN. Where `crate::yard` already
//! decides something server-side — a train's block, a gate bay's
//! staleness, the dock's boarding threshold, the stranded and held
//! lanes — this reads that decision off [`YardStatus`] rather than
//! deciding again. The two predicates the yard decided only on the
//! client are ported here ONCE and pinned against the TypeScript by a
//! test: the train-gate wait (`train_gate_wait_reason` /
//! `train_gate_fallback`, `yard.ts::trainGateTroubled`) and the
//! receiving yard's age bands and pipeline set (`receiving.ts`).
//!
//! NO NUMBER THIS SURFACE MAKES UP. A region whose input could not be
//! read answers `count: null` and `troubled`, with the reason in `why`
//! — never an empty region that reads as "nothing here". A trend with
//! no samples is `null`, never zero.
