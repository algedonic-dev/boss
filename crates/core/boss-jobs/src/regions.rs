//! The IT system map's regions — `GET /api/yard/regions` (design
//! 0524fc95, decided 2026-09-19; this is car 1, the server read).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The Train Yard's KPIs were computed on the client:
//! `apps/web/src/it/yard/yard.ts` read six endpoints and derived every
//! number the page showed, and `boss orient` derived the same numbers
//! again, separately, on the CLI — two definitions of "trains in
//! transit", "time at CI", "dock depth", with nothing holding them
//! equal (a surface may answer differently than its server). A map that
//! bubbles KPIs up needs ONE definition per number. This module is it:
//! a pure function over rows the handler reads, answering a list of
//! REGIONS — dock, gates, track, shed, arrivals, garage, receiving,
//! marshalling — each with a `count` (what is here, in a stated unit), a
//! `state` (clear / attention / troubled, each non-clear one naming the
//! declared band that decided it and how long it has held —
//! [`crate::region_states`], design 62de32ae), a `kpi` and a `trend`
//! (this window versus the previous).
//!
//! THE JUDGEMENTS ARE THE YARD'S OWN. Where `crate::yard` already
//! decides something server-side — a train's block, a gate bay's
//! staleness, the dock's boarding threshold, the stranded and held
//! lanes — this reads that decision off [`YardStatus`] rather than
//! deciding again. The two predicates the yard decided only on the
//! client are ported here ONCE and pinned against the TypeScript by a
//! test: the train-gate wait (`train_gate_wait_reason` /
//! `train_gate_fallback`, `yard.ts::trainGateTroubled`) and the
//! receiving yard's age bands and pipeline set (`receiving.ts`).
//!
//! NO NUMBER THIS SURFACE MAKES UP. A region whose input could not be
//! read answers `count: null` and `troubled`, with the reason in `why`
//! — never an empty region that reads as "nothing here". A trend with
//! no samples is `null`, never zero.

/// car whose probe answers `not yet` — early, not wrong — was never
/// troubled however long it said so, and `not yet` is by far the
/// commonest place a car stops. Measured 2026-09-22: nine cars standing
/// at `proven`, every one `merged = true`, aged 9.0h to **105.7h**, and
/// the shed read `9 landed cars awaiting proof` — the same words it
/// prints ten minutes after a landing. The packet measured 58.3h as the
/// worst case two days earlier, so the age roughly doubled while the
/// COUNT fell from twelve to nine: proofs drain, just slower than they
/// accumulate. That is a rate to be seen, not a queue to be chased.
///
/// WHY 24 HOURS. Most probes are rechecked hourly and most of the
/// events they wait on happen daily, so a car that has not settled
/// inside a day is waiting on something that is not coming on its own.
/// It is a threshold for LOOKING, not a deadline: the car is still
/// correct, still landed, still retrying.

/// the `merged` STEP cannot complete until `proven` does, which is the
