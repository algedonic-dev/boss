//! The IT world map's BORDERS — `GET /api/yard/borders` (design
//! d2154293, decided 2026-09-19; this is car 2).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. Car 1 drew the eight regions as territories in one
//! coordinate space with a rail between each pair, and the rails were
//! decoration: a line with nothing on it. The feedback that opened this
//! design asked to "see the interactivity between regions at the
//! border" (c3105b2a). A border between two regions is a real thing in
//! this system — packets cross it at a rate, packets stand at it
//! waiting to cross, and some machine moves them — so this module
//! answers those three questions for every border the layout declares:
//!
//! 1. **The crossing rate** — packets per day that moved from A to B in
//!    this window, against the same window before it. Each border says
//!    IN WORDS what one crossing is ([`BorderSpec::crossing`]), and the
//!    count is that transition's own stamp in the rows the regions read
//!    (a step completing, a run opening, a train closing).
//! 2. **What is waiting to cross right now**, with the hold reason on
//!    each — greens gated and unparked, runs queued for a bay, cars
//!    parked waiting for a train, cars released by a red train.
//! 3. **The machinery that moves it**, by name, with its last-fired
//!    time.
//!
//! NO NUMBER THIS SURFACE MAKES UP (the same bar as `crate::regions`).
//! A border whose flow cannot be computed — the registry behind one of
//! its rows unread — answers a rate with `null` halves and
//! `waiting: null`, and is TROUBLED. It never answers zero: a zero on a
//! map read at a glance is the false-empty class in its most visible
//! form. Nor is a machine's silence invented: only a machine that
//! DECLARES a heartbeat (a cadence rule) can be judged silent, and
//! `silent: null` means "cannot tell", never "fine".
//!
//! WHAT RECORDS A MACHINE'S FIRING, AND WHAT DOES NOT. A cadence rule
//! is measured: `cadence_firings` holds every firing with its instant
//! and exit code, which is what `yard::conductor_health` already reads.
//! The gate runner is event-driven and keeps no heartbeat, so its last
//! run (a gate-run opening or closing) is the stamp and silence is not
//! a reading. A dispatcher rule is measured too, since backlog
//! b14afc48: `dispatcher_firings` holds one row per firing, written by
//! the rules runner that fired it. What it does NOT hold is an expected
//! interval — an event-driven rule declares no heartbeat — so a
//! dispatcher machine answers `last_fired` and leaves `silent` null.
//! That distinction is the whole reason the table has no `every_minutes`
//! column: a rate invented for an event rule manufactures false silence
//! the first quiet hour.
//!
//! THE BORDER SET IS DATA, HELD EQUAL TO THE CLIENT'S. [`BORDERS`]
//! below is the server's copy of the layout's borders; the client's is
//! `apps/web/src/it/yard/world.ts::BORDERS`, and `borders.test.ts`
//! parses this table out of this file and asserts the two are the same
//! set, in the same order (CLAUDE.md §9a — a fact that lives twice gets
//! an equality test).
