//! `GET /api/departments` and `GET /api/departments/{code}/readiness`
//! — the department list, and which of the six template parts each
//! department has (design 3613f0af, backlog 1dffde5d).
//!
//! Both are READS over live registries and nothing else: the
//! departments registry for what a department IS, the workflow registry for its
//! protocols, the jobs table for their packets and the newest
//! `department-retro`, the sensor registry for what observes on its
//! behalf, and the dispatcher's read surface for the rules that open
//! its kinds. No seed file is opened — David, 2026-09-18: seeds are
//! for OSS bootstrap and the playground; the instance runs on data.
//!
//! A department the departments registry does not hold is a 404 that
//! names the registry and the row it looked for, so a typo reads as a
//! typo and not as "a department with nothing". A registry that is not
//! wired is a 503, the posture every registry-backed door here takes;
//! a registry that is wired and cannot answer leaves that ONE part
//! `has: null` with the error as its reason, because the other five
//! are still worth reading. The READINESS read admits
//! `crate::trust::can_read` — the operator tier, a trusted sibling,
//! and the auditor tier the recorded probe reader carries. The bare
//! LIST asks no tier: it is the org chart the chrome bar renders for
//! every signed-in user (backlog dc5788ba), the posture `/api/classes`
//! it took those tabs over from already had.
//!
//! `POST /api/departments/batch[?mode=insert-if-absent|take]` is the
//! registry's one write (backlog 7edf0e97): a bare JSON array of
//! `declare::DepartmentInput`, the agents batch's shape and posture.
//! It admits `crate::trust::is_trusted` — the tier `boss tenant
//! publish` signs with. Every row runs `declare::validate_batch` (a
//! slug, never a reserved root segment, no twin) and every `function`
//! must be an active Class under `(department, function)`; either
//! refusal is a 422 naming the row, and the whole batch lands or none
//! of it does. The answer is the platform's publish grammar —
//! inserted, updated (from → to), kept (the fields named), unchanged.
