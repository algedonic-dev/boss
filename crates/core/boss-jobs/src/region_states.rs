//! THE IT MAP'S STATE VOCABULARY AND ITS DECLARED BANDS (design
//! 62de32ae, "The IT map, round 3: meaning before drawing", decisions
//! 1, 2 and 5; car A of the plan on backlog c3105b2a).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. A fresh-eyes review on 2026-09-24 found six of the
//! ten regions painted the same amber BUSY, and the word meant three
//! different things: a healthy dock with a train due (the designed
//! state two minutes after any departure), gates at their bound, and a
//! receiving yard holding 325 packets a week old. A colour on most of
//! the map carries no information. The same review watched shop-floor
//! go clear -> troubled -> troubled -> clear across six reads twenty
//! seconds apart, because a run is "finished and not reported" for the
//! few seconds between its build ending and its handback landing — and
//! a red that comes and goes is a check nobody reads (CLAUDE.md
//! §Diagnosis).
//!
//! FOUR WORDS, ONE MEANING EACH, EVERYWHERE — regions and borders:
//!
//!   * `clear`: flowing within its declared bounds. That INCLUDES busy
//!     and healthy — a dock with a train due, a rail moving.
//!   * `full`: a CAPACITY region at its bound while what leaves it keeps
//!     leaving — gates 3/3 with verdicts landing. A GOOD state, and the
//!     only one a border never wears (design e765b3fc §4a, car F1).
//!   * `attention`: a declared band crossed — a number past a line this
//!     table draws, which someone should look at.
//!   * `troubled`: ours, and not moving (the shed's rule, 3881f5c9,
//!     applied to every region), or a reading that could not be taken,
//!     which is refused like a failure rather than drawn as clear.
//!
//! FULL, NOT ATTENTION (David, 2026-09-25, on feedback 84cba7e2: "I want
//! to be able to see that the Gates are full without reading the small
//! text"). Until car F1 a capacity region at its bound turned attention
//! after a hold (`gates-at-bound`, 30m; `shop-floor-at-cap`, 15m), so
//! the gates read amber most of a working day for doing exactly what
//! they are for — a colour on a working bottleneck carries no
//! information. Both bands are retired. At its bound a capacity region
//! is now `full` while its out-route moves and troubled
//! ([`STUCK_AT_CAPACITY`]) when it does not; the one thing still worth a
//! look is the LINE behind it growing past its service time
//! ([`GATES_LINE_LONG`]). The rule is [`at_capacity`].
//!
//! EVERY NON-CLEAR STATE NAMES THE BAND THAT DECIDED IT, so the state
//! can always be checked against the number beside it ("oldest 7d > 3d
//! band"). The bands are declared ONCE, in [`BANDS`] below — the
//! thresholds the regions already enforce are referenced by their own
//! named constants, and the new numbers (the hold periods) live nowhere
//! else.
//!
//! HYSTERESIS, READ FROM THE RECORD. A band's condition changes the
//! state only after it has HELD for the band's declared period. How long
//! it has held is not remembered by this process — it is READ: every
//! condition carries the instant the record says it began (a run's
//! `building` completion, the moment the last bay filled, the day the
//! oldest packet crossed its triage band). So the judgement is a pure
//! function of the rows, identical across replicas, restarts and
//! readers with different scopes, and "troubled for 6m" means the
//! record shows six minutes of it — not that some process happened to
//! be polling. A remembered-state layer was the alternative and was
//! rejected for exactly those three reasons: it would answer
//! differently after a restart, per replica, and per policy scope.
//!
//! What that buys and what it does not, said plainly. A condition that
//! comes and goes faster than its hold never reaches the surface, and
//! one that returns must hold its full period again before it shows —
//! which is the flicker the review measured, damped. A condition that
//! CLEARS clears at once: the record holds when a condition began, and
//! for most conditions it does not hold when one last held, so a
//! "cleared for N minutes" rule would have to be remembered rather than
//! read. A condition whose onset the record does not hold (a train's
//! gate-wait marker carries no stamp) is stated at once, with no
//! duration — an unknown onset is not a pass.
