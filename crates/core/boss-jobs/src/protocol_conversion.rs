//! Can a packet admitted under one protocol version be re-pinned to
//! the next one, automatically?
//!
//! **The problem.** A Job is an immutable envelope plus a protocol set
//! fixed at admission, and in-flight packets stay pinned to the version
//! they were admitted under. That is what makes protocols cheap to
//! edit — publishing v2 cannot disturb work already moving. But it also
//! means every edit strands its in-flight packets on the old version,
//! and the only remedies today are to wait them out or to convert each
//! one by hand.
//!
//! David, 2026-08-18: "we should be able to convert the jobs to the new
//! protocol. In fact, I think we should consider a job protocol
//! translation service. That could figure out whether a packet is
//! convertible from one protocol to the next automatically, for example
//! because the new protocol is strictly looser, and I think we may do
//! this a lot."
//!
//! **The relation.** `v2` is *strictly looser* than `v1` when re-pinning
//! cannot invalidate any state a packet might currently be in, and
//! cannot retroactively demand evidence a packet has already moved past.
//! Loosening is the common shape of a protocol edit — widening who may
//! claim a step, dropping a sign-off, lowering an assurance bar — and
//! every one of those is safe by construction: nothing a packet has
//! already done stops being enough.
//!
//! **This answers a question about SHAPE, not about any one packet.**
//! If v2 is looser than v1, EVERY in-flight v1 packet converts, whatever
//! state it is in — that is what makes the check worth running once per
//! version pair instead of once per packet. When the verdict is
//! `NeedsReview`, some packets may still convert (a stricter step the
//! packet already completed cannot hurt it), but deciding that needs the
//! packet, and this function deliberately does not look at one.
//!
//! **Conservative on purpose.** Every reason this reports is a case
//! where a packet COULD be invalidated, not one where it necessarily is.
//! `NeedsReview` means "a human or a packet-aware pass decides", never
//! "impossible". The failure we cannot afford is the opposite one:
//! silently re-pinning a packet onto a protocol that demands something
//! it never collected, which turns a completed step into a lie about
//! evidence that was never produced.
