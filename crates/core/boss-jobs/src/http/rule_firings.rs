//! `GET /api/yard/rule-firings` — every dispatcher rule's newest firing
//! and its dead-letters, for the rules list (backlog 43c4451a, found by
//! page-audit 08a444bc).
//!
//! WHY. `/it/registry/rules` listed each rule's trigger and version and
//! nothing about whether it RUNS, so a stalled `auto-park-on-gate-green`
//! and an idle one painted the same row — the question the world map's
//! borders answer for the one rule they name, asked of every rule.
//!
//! TWO RECORDS THAT ALREADY EXIST, NO NEW ONE. A firing is the
//! `dispatcher_firings` row the rules runner writes when every handler
//! succeeded (b14afc48); a failure past the redelivery budget is the
//! `dead_letter` annotation the runner lands on the packet it owed
//! (a9c498eb) — or, when the topic names no packet, the `dead-letter`
//! row it records in `dispatcher_firings` instead (4b175523). This
//! handler reads them and reduces the dead-letters per rule
//! ([`crate::dispatcher_firings::dead_letter_rollup`], pure and
//! unit-tested). It lives beside the borders because it is the same
//! record the borders read; the rules themselves are the dispatcher's,
//! and the page joins the two by rule name.
//!
//! UNREAD IS NOT EMPTY. Each half is `null` with its reason when it
//! cannot be read — no record wired, a failed read, a caller whose
//! policy reads no packets, or more dead-lettered packets than one page
//! holds — because an empty list would paint every rule "no firing" or
//! "no failures" on no evidence, which is how a dead machine reads
//! healthy.
