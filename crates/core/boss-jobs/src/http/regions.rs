//! `GET /api/yard/regions?window=24h` — the IT system map's KPI read
//! (design 0524fc95, decided 2026-09-19; car 1).
//!
//! Nine regions — dock, gates, track, shed, arrivals, garage,
//! receiving, marshalling, shop-floor — each with a count, a
//! clear/attention/troubled
//! state and a trend over the window, computed ONCE here from the rows
//! this process already reads for the yard status, so the map (car 2),
//! the yard and `boss orient` answer with one voice. The aggregation is
//! [`crate::regions::regions`], pure and unit-tested; this handler is
//! the adapter that reads the rows.
//!
//! THE SAME PASS AS THE YARD STATUS. The status and the map used to be
//! two client-side derivations of six reads; here the map is a function
//! of the status's own pass ([`super::yard::read_yard`]) plus the
//! windowed tails the trends need — the closed trains, cars and
//! gate-runs of the last two windows, the receiving yard's inbound
//! packets, the marshalling stations' load and flow, and the shop
//! floor's runs, crews and declared capacity. Every read
//! that cannot answer states so (`None` → a troubled region with
//! `count: null`), never an empty region that reads as clear.
