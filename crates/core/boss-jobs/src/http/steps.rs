///
/// 1. A header that does not verify is refused, whatever else is true

/// 3. A presence step that declares sign-off roles completes on its
///    STAMPS: every required role holds a live stamp a passkey produced
///    over the step's current shape, inside the declared age
///    (`Step::stamped_presence`,
///    `boss_core::job::PRESENCE_STAMP_COMPLETES_FOR_HOURS`). The request
///    then needs a session only, and may come from any actor the
///    step-update policy admits — David's answer on `completer`: "think
///    about an admin grabbing 5 sign-offs". A ticket on the request is
///    not an alternative to a missing stamp: the roles are who approves,
///    and the completer's passkey is not theirs.
/// 4. A presence step with NO roles keeps the rule it had: the request
///    carries a verifying ticket for this step, shape and actor, because
///    that completion is the only act there is.
///
/// A HUMAN-ONLY STEP IS THE SAME JUDGEMENT WITH A PERSON IN IT (David,
/// 2026-10-07, item 570c66e9 `human_only_by_passkey_20261007`).
/// `judge_assurance` has already raised its requirement to presence, so
/// rules 3 and 4 apply to it whether or not it declared presence, and
/// the roster check that was the whole enforcement stays beside the
/// passkey — added to, not swapped for:
///
/// - rule 3 (roles): every stamp that carries it is BY A PERSON
///   (`human_only::person_check` on the stamp's authority). Who sends
///   the completion is then free — his second sentence: "I stamp the
///   instructions so the step no longer requires human completion".
/// - rule 4 (no roles): the actor sending the completion is a person,
///   and the ticket is theirs. Asked BEFORE the ticket, so an automation
///   is told it is not a person (403, as it always was) rather than sent
///   to run a ceremony it has no passkey for.
///
/// The completer's roster check used to stand alone above this call
/// (adac8fa4). It lives here now so the two arms cannot drift: with
/// roles it moved from the completer to the signers; without, it stayed
/// on the completer.
///
/// Read off `step` as STORED, never the body laid over it: the caller

    // `PATCH .../steps/{id}/metadata`, is the ONE writer of step
    // metadata, and every writer in the tree sends its keys there and
    // PUTs the status alone.

    // merging silently changes the meaning of EVERY existing call at
    // once — a caller that clears a key by omitting it would stop
    // clearing it, invisibly and retroactively. A refusal is loud and
    // arrives at the one call site that must change, which is the shape
    // the terminal-step refusal below already has.

    // WHY ANY BODY, not only one that omits a key. Stage 1 (car
    // b8a1d469) refused the omission, which stopped the silent wipe
    // but kept a second writer: a read-merge-write sent every key it
    // READ, so a key a concurrent writer landed between that read and
    // this write was refused at best and, for a writer that re-read,
    // overwritten with the value it read. The merge door lands only
    // the keys a caller names, against the row as it stands.

    // A TERMINAL STEP WHOSE METADATA THE BODY WOULD CHANGE is left to
