    // The overlay above replaces `metadata` WHOLESALE, so a body that
    // omits a key deletes it. Three keys were hand-carried past that
    // replace — `authority_role`, `human_only`, `agent_run` — each

    // erased it and the run died four hours later on the silence clock,
    // b91a2103), and two more step-level keys were in flight. The list
    // grew by incident; this removes the class instead.
    //
    // WHY REFUSE AND NOT MERGE, since merging looks obviously nicer:
    // merging silently changes the meaning of EVERY existing call at
    // once — a caller that clears a key by omitting it today would stop
    // clearing it, invisibly and retroactively. A refusal is loud and
    // arrives at the one call site that must change, which is the shape
    // the terminal-step refusal below already has. A read-merge-write
    // caller sends every stored key and is untouched; a PUT with no
    // `metadata` key (a status-only flip) is not judged; a caller whose
    // read went stale while a concurrent writer added a key is now
    // caught instead of erasing that key. Clearing on purpose is the
    // merge door's job, with the key sent as `null`.
    //
    // NOT ON A TERMINAL STEP. The merge door refuses a terminal step
    // too, so routing the caller there would send it from one 409 to
    // another; the terminal refusal below speaks instead (an omitting
    // body changes the metadata, so it fires), and its hint names the
    // doors that work on a record. An unchanged re-send is not an
    // omission and stays the no-op the freeze lets through.
    //
    // STAGE 1 of design 93d2bddb (decided_2026_09_24b on e39a9d2a): the
