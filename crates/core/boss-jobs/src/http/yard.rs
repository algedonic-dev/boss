//! `GET /api/yard/status` — the yard status read-model.
//!
//! "What is the yard doing, and why?" answered from the system of record
//! in one payload: in-flight trains and exactly where each sits (with the
//! block reason surfaced when one is stuck — the fact that used to live
//! buried in a step's metadata), the loading dock, the boarding predicate
//! rendered from the LIVE cadence rows, recent arrivals, and the cheap
//! stranded-green signal. The aggregation is [`crate::yard::build_status`],
//! pure and unit-tested; this handler is the adapter that reads the rows.
//!
//! WHY SERVER-SIDE. The `/api/cadence/*` and `/api/delivery/policy/*`
//! doors are operator-only (a browser session is neither guest nor
//! operator, so a client read gets 403). This process holds those
//! repositories already, so it reads them directly — no auth barrier, no
//! second round trip — and composes a browser-safe payload behind the
//! ordinary `job` read scope, exactly as `queue_age` and `stations_load`
//! do. The boarding predicate's numbers therefore come from the live
//! registry, never a constant baked into the page.
