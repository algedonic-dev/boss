//! `POST /api/network/census` — where the packet-loss census lands.
//!
//! The census (docs/design/packet-loss.md, decided in review
//! `9fb9904f`) is computed by the dispatcher's `network.census`
//! handler over this API's own read surfaces — /api/jobs totals,
//! /api/stations, each station's queue. Q3's ruling is that the
//! counts become a MEASURED SERIES on the log, one event per firing,
//! so loss is a queryable trend rather than a spot check. Dispatcher
//! handlers own no database — they speak HTTP to the public surface
//! like any caller — so the jobs service, which owns the network
//! substrate the census measures, provides the one write: accept the
//! counts, stamp the actor, record exactly one `jobs.network.census`
//! event through the repository's standalone-event path
//! (`record_events` — the same reliable-delivery outbox path the
//! post-materialization `step.ready.<kind>` markers use).
//!
//! DELIBERATELY A DUMB DOOR. The endpoint validates shape (a JSON
//! object) and trust (operator tier), and records what it was
//! handed. It does NOT recompute or cross-check the counts: the
//! census's honesty lives in the handler that measured, and a door
//! that second-guesses its instrument is a second instrument. The
//! payload field list is owned by the handler
//! (boss-dispatcher-handlers `network_census`), same as every other
//! marker's payload is owned by its emitter.
//!
//! OPERATOR TIER ONLY, mirroring the cadence surface's posture:
//! the census is operator machinery. The dispatcher stamps
//! `access_tier: operator` on every rule-as-actor header, and the
//! gateway injects `x-boss-user` for external callers, so an
//! unauthenticated hit parses as guest and is refused. Writes also
//! pass the machine gate when a token is configured, like every
//! other state-changing route on this router.
