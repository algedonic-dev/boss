//! `GET /api/yard/moves` and `GET /api/yard/moves/stream` — the moves
//! record served, and the loop that writes it (design e765b3fc §3; car
//! M1 on feedback 84cba7e2). The record itself — what a move is, the
//! diff, the fold — is [`crate::moves`], pure and unit-tested; this is
//! the adapter: the mover loop that reads the log and the map, and the
//! two reads that serve what it wrote.
//!
//! ONE MOVER PER REPLICA, NOT PER VIEWER. `/api/events/stream` runs one
//! poll of the log per viewer and hands raw payloads to the page, which
//! would then have to place packets itself — a second placement function
//! in TypeScript, the defect CLAUDE.md §9a names. Here one loop reads the
//! log's head once a second, places packets through the partition the
//! regions read is pinned to, writes the moves, and publishes each
//! recorded row to every open stream on this replica. A viewer costs a
//! channel subscription.
//!
//! THE STREAM RESUMES FROM THE RECORD. A viewer that reconnects with
//! `Last-Event-ID` (or `?since=`) is sent the rows after it from
//! `yard_moves` — a range read, not a replay — and one that connects
//! fresh, falls behind, or asks past what a backfill holds is sent a
//! `resync`: take the current placement, nothing moved. A restart never
//! animates a flood that did not happen.
//!
//! ACCESS: a caller who reads every packet. The regions read, which
//! already shows these branches and titles, narrows its rows to a scoped
//! caller's packets; a move row carries no owner to narrow on, so a
//! scoped caller is refused by name rather than served a record that
//! names packets outside its scope — or an empty one that reads as
//! "nothing moved".
