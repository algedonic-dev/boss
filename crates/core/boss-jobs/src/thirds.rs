//! THE HUD'S ROWS — one per third of the operator surface, and the one
//! whole-system machine cell (design 00774ca8, "The HUD frame:
//! whole-system figures, fixed, one row per third", approved by David
//! 2026-09-24; car F of design 62de32ae).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The HUD answers about the WHOLE system and the map
//! answers about the parts (design 17567423). Until this module the only
//! whole-system figure on /it was `borders.ts::summaryLine`, which the
//! CLIENT computed by adding up border rows — and that sum double-counted
//! about 260 backlog items, because two borders counted largely the same
//! packets (62de32ae decision 4). So every figure here is computed ONCE,
//! on the server, counting each packet once by id, and the HUD and
//! `boss orient` both print it. No client adds anything up.
//!
//! EACH ROW CARRIES TWO FIGURES that no single territory can answer
//! (decision 2):
//!
//! * **Balance** — is the third taking work in faster than it lets work
//!   out? In/day against out/day at the third's outer edges, in ONE unit
//!   per third, each packet counted once. "Out" includes packets that
//!   CLOSE inside the third: a finished run leaves actors-building by
//!   closing, not by crossing a border. The net is written here too, so
//!   the one subtraction a reader would otherwise do happens once.
//! * **Stuck · waiting** — [`crate::regions::ThirdStuck`] exactly as
//!   [`crate::regions::stuck`] answers it, side by side and never summed.
//!
//! ONE UNIT PER THIRD, and the edge pair says which ([`BALANCE`]). A
//! third's in and out must count the same thing — "trains against cars"
//! is the example the design names — so each edge declares its unit and
//! `a_thirds_two_edges_count_one_unit` refuses a pair that differs:
//!
//! | third            | unit             | in                          | out                                    |
//! |------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
//! | queue-management | inbound packets  | an inbound packet opened    | its first run opened, or its close     |
//! | actors-building  | runs             | a run opened                | a run closed                           |
//! | delivery         | cars             | a car parked on a green     | a car closed                           |
//!
//! NO NUMBER THIS SURFACE MAKES UP (the bar of `crate::regions`). An
//! edge whose rows could not be read answers `null`, never zero, and the
//! balance says which read failed in `why`. The net is `null` whenever
//! either half is.
