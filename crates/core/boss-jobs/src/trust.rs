//! Who an operator-machinery door admits — ONE definition.
//!
//! Five doors (`agent_runs`, `cadence`, `credentials`, `delivery`,
//! `surface_opens`) each carried their own copy of `is_trusted`, and on
//! 2026-09-15 one of them learned that its READS must also admit the
//! auditor tier — the tier the recorded-probe reader carries
//! (the unattended prove door: `audit-readonly` at `auditor`,
//! signing as `automation:run-car-probe-reader`) — because without it
//! no car about that surface could ever be proved through
//! `boss-sor-read`, the one reader a probe may use. The other four did
//! not learn it. Measured 2026-09-16 (backlog 839335b7) as that reader
//! against the system of record: `/api/delivery/policy/default`,
//! `/api/credentials`, `/api/cadence/rules` and
//! `/api/cadence/rules/{name}/last-firing` answered 403; the agent-run
//! surfaces 200. A car about the cadence, the delivery policy or the
//! credential registry was unprovable, silently.
//!
//! A fact that lives five times gets collapsed (CLAUDE.md §9a): the two
//! predicates live here and the doors import them.
