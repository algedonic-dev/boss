//! THE PARTITION (design 62de32ae decision 4, decided 2026-09-24): every
//! packet a region counts, it counts ALONE. The eight regions whose own
//! predicates name what they hold claim first ([`claimed`]); receiving
//! and marshalling are the remainder ([`members`]).
//!
//! ONE PLACEMENT FUNCTION (design e765b3fc §2a, car R1). Which region
//! holds a packet is decided packet by packet by [`place`], over the
//! lookups one reading builds ([`Lookups`]); [`members`] is a fold of
//! `place` over every packet the reading names. So what a region counts
//! and where a packet stands are one answer — the counts, the rails and
//! the moves record (`crate::moves`) cannot disagree (CLAUDE.md §9a).
//!
//! A TRAIN IS PLACED BY ITS ACTIVE STEP, not all on the track: made up
//! at the dock, at the gates while its train gate runs, on the track once
//! it has merged ([`train_region`]). David, on feedback 84cba7e2: "like
//! how the dock routes a train over to the gates before it departs onto
//! the tracks" — and that is what the conductor does. What a train
//! carries rides it ([`Placed::Aboard`]): the cars it boarded, and its
//! own train gate while it stands at the gates, which is the train under
//! test and holds its bay as the train, counted once.
