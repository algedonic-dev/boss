//! The IT system map's regions — `GET /api/yard/regions` (design
//! 0524fc95, decided 2026-09-19; this is car 1, the server read).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The Train Yard's KPIs were computed on the client:
//! `apps/web/src/it/yard/yard.ts` read six endpoints and derived every
//! number the page showed, and `boss orient` derived the same numbers
//! again, separately, on the CLI — two definitions of "trains in
//! transit", "time at CI", "dock depth", with nothing holding them
//! equal (a surface may answer differently than its server). A map that
//! bubbles KPIs up needs ONE definition per number. This module is it:
//! a pure function over rows the handler reads, answering a list of
//! REGIONS — dock, gates, track, shed, arrivals, garage, receiving,
//! marshalling — each with a `count` (what is here, in a stated unit), a
//! `state` (clear / attention / troubled, each non-clear one naming the
//! declared band that decided it and how long it has held —
//! [`crate::region_states`], design 62de32ae), a `kpi` and a `trend`
//! (this window versus the previous).
//!
//! THE JUDGEMENTS ARE THE YARD'S OWN. Where `crate::yard` already
//! decides something server-side — a train's block, a gate bay's
//! staleness, the dock's boarding threshold, the stranded and held
//! lanes — this reads that decision off [`YardStatus`] rather than
//! deciding again. The two predicates the yard decided only on the
//! client are ported here ONCE and pinned against the TypeScript by a
//! test: the train-gate wait (`train_gate_wait_reason` /
//! `train_gate_fallback`, `yard.ts::trainGateTroubled`) and the
//! receiving yard's age bands and pipeline set (`receiving.ts`).
//!
//! NO NUMBER THIS SURFACE MAKES UP. A region whose input could not be
//! read answers `count: null` and `troubled`, with the reason in `why`
//! — never an empty region that reads as "nothing here". A trend with
//! no samples is `null`, never zero.
//!
//! ONE FILE PER SEAM (backlog 07addeed, 2026-09-24). This module was one
//! 8,132-line file, and the file builder runs read most (182 reads on
//! 2026-09-24), so each read paid for all of it to see one region. It is
//! split along the seams it already had — pure moves, the same public
//! paths: everything a caller named as `crate::regions::X` is still
//! re-exported here as `X`.
//!
//! - this file — the answer's shape ([`Regions`], [`Region`],
//!   [`Machine`], [`Measure`]), what is read ([`RegionInputs`]), and
//!   [`regions`] itself, which asks one judge per region for its card;
//! - `judging` — stamps, windows, trends and the card every judge
//!   returns ([`region`], [`unread_settled`]): the shared judging;
//! - `partition` — every packet a region counts, it counts alone;
//! - one judge per region, in map order: `dock`, `gates`, `track`,
//!   `shed` (and `stale_proof`, whose wait a stale car is), `arrivals`,
//!   `garage`, `receiving`, `marshalling`, `shop_floor`, `publish`;
//! - `machinery` — the machines standing in each region, and the plant;
//! - `stuck` — what is stuck, per third.
//!
//! Each file's tests sit beside its code; the rows they build a yard
//! from are `fixtures`.
