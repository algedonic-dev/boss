//! Static validation for `StationSpec` rows — the station **viability
//! lint**, the counterpart to [`crate::workflow_lint`].
//!
//! A Workflow is a program and its lint proves the program can finish.
//! A station is a *queue declaration*, and the failure mode is not a
//! program that cannot finish — it is a queue that silently holds
//! nothing, or that behaves differently from what the row says. Both
//! are invisible: an empty queue and a correctly-empty queue render
//! identically, so a station that can never match is indistinguishable
//! from a quiet day. That is the whole reason this file exists.
//!
//! Every rule below refuses a row that is wrong *on its own terms* —
//! provable from the spec alone, with no reference to what packets
//! happen to exist. A station holding nothing today is not a defect; a
//! station that could not hold anything on any day is.
//!
//! - **Contradictory metadata.** A key in both `metadata_present` and
//!   `metadata_absent`. No packet can satisfy both. The step clause has
//!   the same shape: a key demanded both `metadata_unmarked` and
//!   `metadata_equals` a marker value.
//! - **Terminal status with no window.** `status: closed|cancelled`
//!   while `terminal_window_days` is unset. The evaluation universe is
//!   in-flight packets (`http/stations.rs` filters `JobStatus::Open`
//!   unless a window is declared), so the clause can never match.
//! - **Inert window.** The mirror image: a `terminal_window_days`
//!   retention rule on a predicate pinned to a non-terminal status.
//!   The window is dead configuration — it reads as "departed packets
//!   linger here" and nothing ever will.
//! - **The `@me` biconditional.** `kind: actor` means the queue
//!   depends on who is asking, and [`SELF`] is the only thing that
//!   makes it so. An `actor` row without `@me` shows every executor
//!   the same queue while claiming to be personal; a shared row *with*
//!   `@me` varies per viewer while claiming to be shared — which is
//!   what made the census read a per-actor station as depth 0 and
//!   overstate orphaned packets at 92% when the real figure was 75%.
//! - **Non-positive WIP limit.** `wip_limit <= 0` declares a station
//!   that is over its bandwidth while empty. Retiring the row is how
//!   you close a station.
//! - **Self-parented rollup.** `rollup_parent == name` is a
//!   one-element cycle; a renderer walking parents does not return.
//!
//! Runs at author time (`POST /api/stations/_validate`) and at publish
//! time (inside `StationRegistry::publish`, in BOTH adapters, against
//! the row the transaction actually promotes). One definition, two
//! call sites — because the 2026-08-13 outage was precisely a
//! `_validate` that could name the problem and a publish path that
//! never asked it.
//!
//! **Not yet covered: boot.** A row INSERTed straight into `stations`
//! by a SQL seed never passes through `publish`, so it bypasses this
//! file entirely — the same hole `workflow_quarantine` closes for
//! Workflows. Every row live today is viable (checked against the
//! deployed registry when this landed), so the gap is latent rather
//! than active; closing it is tracked separately.
