//! `boss-platform-workflow-seed` — load the platform Workflow bundle
//! into the registry, inserting only what is missing.
//!
//! David, 2026-08-15: "get those protocols prioritized to be fully
//! moved into data and registry configurations. That is hunting
//! leakage between the layers too." Three of the four registries
//! carrying the operating model already seed as data; `workflows` did
//! not, and a kind that lives as a Rust literal cannot be changed
//! without a deploy — CLAUDE.md's own definition of a protocol that
//! has leaked into the substrate.
//!
//! INSERT-IF-MISSING, AND NOTHING ELSE. This is protocols-as-data Q1,
//! as David answered it: "the seed binary inserts what is missing and
//! touches nothing that exists — the same idempotent posture
//! boss-operator-baseline-seed already has ... Drift-healing goes away
//! deliberately: it is the feature that reverts operator edits."
//!
//! So this deliberately does NOT reconcile. `bootstrap_reconcile`
//! republishes the code default over any bootstrap-owned row whose body
//! drifted, which is exactly how two protocol edits were silently
//! undone on 2026-08-14 (68331085). A kind that has moved to the bundle
//! is out of `platform_workflows()` and therefore out of reconcile's
//! reach; this binary gives it a first version and then leaves it
//! alone forever.
//!
//! Publishing goes through `create_draft` + `publish` rather than an
//! INSERT, so the viability lint runs on every row exactly as it would
//! for a workflow authored in the UI. A malformed bundle fails here,
//! loudly, on the deployment that is booting — not later, on the first
//! Job that tries to use it.
