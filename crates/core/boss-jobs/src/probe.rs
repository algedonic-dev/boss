//! WHICH PROBES ARE LEGAL — one definition, every door.
//!
//! A car records a probe (`boss_jobs::car::PROOF_PROBE`) and several
//! things later RUN it: `boss gate --park-probe` admits the text,
//! `boss prove --probe / --from-car / --recheck` runs it by hand, the
//! `jobs.run-car-probes` rule ships it to the forge on arrival, and
//! `boss prove --from-car --unattended` executes it there. The rules about
//! which text is worth running live HERE, in one place all of those can
//! reach, because the alternative is what backlog 23b2dffa found: the
//! gate refused two shapes of bad probe, the hand verb refused neither,
//! and the only trace of the rule at the second door was a comment
//! describing the first (CLAUDE.md §9a in its behavioural form — one
//! rule, two enforcement sites, one of which is prose about the other).
//!
//! THREE QUESTIONS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME KIND OF QUESTION. The
//! first asks whether the text can RUN where it is going, which is
//! host-relative ([`needs_absent_tool`]). The second asks whether its
//! answer can be TRUSTED, which is true everywhere
//! ([`reads_the_sor_unidentified`]). The third asks whether the text
//! says what its author meant — a `jq -e` whose success branch is
//! `empty` ([`asserts_its_own_negation`]), a bare `|| exit n` that
//! throws away the status naming the cause
//! ([`rewrites_its_exit_status`]), a `-lt` on a variable nothing checked
//! was a number ([`compares_an_unguarded_number`]) — which is also true
//! everywhere.
//!
//! Each door applies the first only about the host it is actually
//! sending the probe to, and the other two always. The second REFUSES,
//! because it fails open: the probe passes, the absence assertion is
//! green against a world it was never allowed to see, and a car closes
//! on a proof of nothing. The third only WARNS, because it fails
//! closed — `boss prove` records nothing on a nonzero exit, so the worst
//! it does is strand a car and misdescribe why (18 hours of that,
//! 4fccc595) — and because its detectors are coarse text scans a
//! false refusal would be too expensive for. The one third-kind shape
//! that REFUSES is a git date read with its offset
//! ([`reads_git_time_with_an_offset`]): a string compare of
//! mixed-offset timestamps lies in both directions (c0ac92b8), so it
//! is judged the way the second question is.
//!
//! The predicates below are shared; the wording of a refusal or a
//! warning belongs to the door, because what to do instead differs by
//! door.
//!
//! WHICH SHAPE OF PROBE A GIVEN CLAIM ADMITS — a different question from
//! any of the three above, and the one that actually cost a session:
//! docs/design/a-probe-shape-follows-the-car.md, keyed to what the car
//! changed.
