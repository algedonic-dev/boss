//! Static validation for `WorkflowSpec` rows — the **viability lint**.
//!
//! A Workflow is a program written in the StepType alphabet; its step
//! DAG is implicit in the steps' `ready_when` predicates. The lint
//! proves the program is well-formed before it can run:
//!
//! - **Phase 0 — metadata shapes.** Every value in a step's
//!   `metadata_defaults` matches its StepType field's declared type
//!   (catches a not-in-enum value like `channel = "in-person"` at
//!   author time instead of mid-run).
//! - **Phase 1 — structural.** At least one trigger (`ready_when =
//!   "true"`), at least one terminal, every `steps.<slug>` reference
//!   resolves, the dependency graph is acyclic, and every leaf is a
//!   declared terminal.
//! - **Phase 2 — reachability.** Every step is reachable forward from
//!   some trigger and backward from some terminal — no dead code.
//! - **Phase 4 — a sign-off cannot arrive blind.** A `sign-off` step
//!   asks a PERSON to approve something, and the UI renders the step
//!   the reader is on — so a sign-off whose context is nowhere is an
//!   empty screen with an Approve button. Either the step declares its
//!   own required fields or a procedure, or some step it depends on
//!   REQUIRES a field, which is what guarantees the context exists
//!   before the packet can reach a human.
//! - **Phase 3 — fork coverage.** Where a step is a fork point (≥2
//!   successors discriminate on its outcome), every value of the
//!   discriminating enum is handled by some successor, or a wildcard
//!   fallback covers the open-ended case.
//! - **Phase 6 — a terminal cannot fire on create.** A terminal gated
//!   on a job-metadata MARKER must read false while that marker is
//!   absent — otherwise the dispatcher's complete-on-ready rule closes
//!   the Job at that outcome the instant it opens. Catches the
//!   `job.metadata.x != ""` / `NOT job.metadata.x` footgun over an
//!   `Absent` field that auto-superseded `incident-post-mortem` packets
//!   on create (cb9661fe).
//!
//! Runs at author time (`POST /api/workflows/_validate`), publish
//! time (every registry path that can set a row ACTIVE — see
//! [`gate_active`]), and boot time (`workflow_quarantine`).
//! One definition, four call sites: the author-time dry run and the
//! publish gate cannot disagree about what "viable" means, which is
//! exactly how the 2026-08-13 outage happened — `_validate` could
//! name the problem the whole time, and publish never asked it.

/// human until the context exists.
///
/// Deliberately narrow, in two directions.
///
/// SCOPED TO `sign-off` STEPS, because those are the ones a person is

/// SCOPED TO `category = "platform"` WORKFLOWS — the ones this
/// deployment actually operates. The two worked-example tenants carry
/// 33 more blind sign-offs between them (brewery 11, used-device-shop
/// 22), and they are a real gap in the product story rather than an
