//! EACH SIDING LANDS ON ITS OWN EVIDENCE — design c6bd173e, car 3
//! (backlog edae6e8b, 2026-09-15).
//!
//! Car 1 laid the four arrivals sidings and placed a landed wagon on
//! the siding of its `delivery_channel`; car 2 stamped a train with the
//! heaviest of its cars'. Both still read "landed" off ONE fact — the
//! train's `converged` step, the image roll — whatever the car changed.
//! The design's first decision says otherwise: a wagon lands on its
//! siding when ITS channel's live evidence exists. This module is that
//! reading, per car, from the packets each channel's converge already
//! leaves behind.
//!
//! WHAT EACH CHANNEL'S EVIDENCE IS — measured 2026-09-15 on the system
//! of record for train #382 (merge 34db709 at 16:10:28Z):
//!
//! - **config** — the `maintenance-cluster-converge` packet: the
//!   forge's deploy runner builds forge main, applies
//!   infra/cluster/manifests and verifies them, and its `run` step
//!   carries `build_head` (a SHORT sha) with `verify_s` when the
//!   manifests verified, or `unchanged` when the head was already on.
//!   Closed 16:14:46Z — six minutes BEFORE the converged step.
//! - **software** — the train's `converged` step: the conductor read
//!   the cluster jobs API self-reporting the merge (`cluster_commit`),
//!   16:20:45Z.
//! - **infra** — the host converge packets, `maintenance-forge-converge`
//!   (forge, 16:16:07Z) and `maintenance-boss-gcp-converge` (boss-gcp,
//!   16:34:23Z — fourteen minutes AFTER the image roll, which is the
//!   case car 1 could not draw). Each `run` step carries the
//!   `converge_sha` the host is on and its `node_id`.
//! - **data** — nothing of its own yet. The design names the
//!   live-protocols / live-rules equality read off the SoR; today that
//!   equality is a tree-side lint over the registry's kind SET, and the
//!   registry loads its files at the boot of the converged image. So a
//!   data car lands on the software evidence, and its row SAYS so.
//!
//! WHAT THIS READER CANNOT KNOW, AND HOW IT COPES. The yard has no git,
//! so it cannot ask whether a later head CONTAINS a merge. The
//! conductor can, and already did: a `converged` step's
//! `cluster_commit` is a head the conductor proved contains the merge
//! (by equality or `merge-base --is-ancestor`, train.rs). So a converge
//! packet at EITHER the merge sha or that cluster commit is evidence
//! for the merge. A host that skipped both — moved from before the
//! merge straight past the cluster's commit — reads as still converging
//! until the window says it cannot judge; the honest gap, named on the
//! row rather than papered over.
//!
//! The packets are read in a WINDOW, and a window is not the record.
//! A train whose merge predates the oldest packet read cannot be judged
//! "converging" — the evidence may simply be older than the read — so
//! its landing is `unread`, with the window's edge on the row.
