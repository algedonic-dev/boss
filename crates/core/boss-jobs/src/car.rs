//! Shared builders for a ship-a-change "car": the packet body and the
//! per-step evidence, plus the `Receipt` type they carry.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS IN CORE. Filing a car — POST the ship-a-change packet,
//! then fill its scope/build/gate steps with the receipt copied
//! verbatim — is done two ways now: by `boss park` (a human parks after
//! a green gate) and by the dispatcher's auto-park handler (a rule parks
//! on the gate-run's green step). If each built the packet its own way
//! they would drift, and the one field that must never be rebuilt is the
//! receipt (that is the bug `boss park` was created to kill). So the
//! pure builders live here, shared by both callers; the HTTP
//! orchestration (the POST and the PUTs) stays with each caller, because
//! that part legitimately differs. CLAUDE.md 9a: collapse the fact that
//! would otherwise live twice.
