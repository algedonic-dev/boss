//! Rebuild the `jobs` + `steps` projections from `audit_log`.
//!
//! Second projection rebuilder in the event-canonical arc (after
//! `boss-messages`). See `docs/design/projection-rebuilders.md`.
//!
//! Event topology — only the **state events** drive the rebuild;
//! the **marker events** (`status_changed`, `closed`, `completed`,
//! `signed_off`, `corrected`, `repinned`) are informational duplicates
//! and are skipped. `signed_off` is checked, not applied: a marker whose
//! stamp no state event carries is counted in
//! [`RebuildReport::sign_offs_unreproduced`] (backlog f146a13a).
//!
//! State events:
//! - `jobs.job.created`  — full Job row → INSERT
//! - `jobs.job.updated`  — full Job row → UPSERT (UPDATE if exists,
//!   INSERT if not — tolerates missing CREATE in pre-enrichment
//!   audit slices)
//! - `jobs.step.created` — full Step row → INSERT
//! - `jobs.step.updated` — full Step row → UPSERT
//! - `jobs.step.stamps_invalidated` — the stamps an edit voided
//!   (design 87329a13): each listed stamp on the row marked dead; an
//!   event from before the list existed voids every stamp alive on the
//!   row at that point, which is what the edit that emitted it left
//!   stale. And a void is permanent: a later state event whose payload
//!   carries a dead stamp alive (every payload written before voids
//!   existed) does not revive it — the upsert keeps the row's voids.
//!
//! Schema columns `created_at` / `updated_at` get filled from the
//! audit_log row's own `timestamp` field — the event-time recorded
//! by `DomainPublisher.emit`. Same shape as Layer 2 of the
//! immutable-audit-log: events are the canonical clock, projections
//! follow.
