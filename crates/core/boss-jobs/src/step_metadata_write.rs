//! THE TWO STEP-METADATA DOORS, AS PURE RULES (backlog e39a9d2a).
//!
//! A step's metadata has two writers: the step PUT, which overlays its
//! body onto the stored step and so REPLACES `metadata` wholesale, and
//! the merge door, `PATCH /api/jobs/{id}/steps/{step_id}/metadata`,
//! which lands keys one at a time and deletes a key sent as `null`.
//!
//! The PUT refuses a metadata body that OMITS a stored key
//! ([`omitted_keys`]); the merge door answers a re-send that changes
//! nothing on a terminal step with success ([`patch_is_noop`]). Both
//! rules are here, pure, so the handlers do only the I/O and the test
//! doubles that answer the way the real API does (the boss-cli stub,
//! the dispatcher mocks) can call the same function rather than
//! retyping it (CLAUDE.md §9a).
