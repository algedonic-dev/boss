//! Station registry — stations.md (Q1–Q4 ratified 2026-08-13).
//!
//! A **station** is an abstract priority queue that routes or holds
//! job-packet traffic until there is bandwidth or capability to
//! handle the packet. Everything about a station is registry data —
//! never a code path. Membership is DERIVED: the row's `predicate`
//! is evaluated over open Jobs at read time (see
//! [`crate::station_queue`]); there is no mutable current-station
//! field on the packet.
//!
//! Shape mirrors `StepPluginRegistry` / `WorkflowRegistry`:
//! append-only versioning + a status lifecycle (draft → active →
//! retired), a partial unique index enforcing at most one active row
//! per name, and every write recording its event atomically with the
//! row (the workflow-registry-events posture).
