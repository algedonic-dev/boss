//! Wire types for the cadence surface.
//!
//! `CadenceRuleRow` is deliberately the RAW registry row — nullable
//! basis-specific columns and all — not a parsed rule. The conductor
//! owns the parse because it owns the consequence: a malformed row is
//! skipped loudly in the conductor's journal every tick, which is
//! where an operator reads it. An API that parsed and 500'd would turn
//! one bad registry row into a dead cadence loop.
