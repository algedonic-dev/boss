//! `CadenceRuleRow` is deliberately the RAW registry row — nullable
//! basis-specific columns and all — not a parsed rule. The conductor
//! owns the parse because it owns the consequence: a malformed row is
//! skipped loudly in the conductor's journal every tick, which is
//! where an operator reads it. An API that parsed and 500'd would turn
//! one bad registry row into a dead cadence loop.

/// and idle-firing outcomes on it, and the yard decides whether a
/// `basis=clock` row is a BOARDING trigger worth describing to the
/// operator ("Boards at 06:05 / 18:05 UTC") on it. It lived only in the
/// conductor until 634a475b, so the yard selected clock rows by basis
/// alone and would have named a clock row with any other verb as a
/// boarding window — latent while the only live clock row is
/// `train-window` with verb `run`. Tier 1 owns it because Tier 1 cannot
/// read the orchestrator, and both readers can read here.
