//! Q's registry, projected from P's protocols.
//!
//! David, 2026-08-16: *"Q should have a registry of every required
//! station, which are both concrete actor queues and constraint-based
//! queues where any actor that meets constraints can act against it.
//! We have lots of protocols with steps with constraints, so we should
//! have lots of stations to show."*
//!
//! THE MEASUREMENT THAT FORCED THIS. 45 active Workflows carry 302
//! steps, 178 of which declare an `authority_role`, across 22 distinct
//! roles and **51 distinct `(step-kind, role)` constraints**. Three
//! stations had been authored by hand. The gap is not neglect: a step
//! that says "a `bookkeeper` does a `bill-approval`" has ALREADY
//! declared a queue, and writing a station row to say it again is
//! CLAUDE.md §9a's fact living twice. Hand-authoring fifty-one of them
//! was never going to happen, and it didn't.
//!
//! So a constraint station is not authored. It is a projection of the
//! protocol set, and it is regenerated when the protocols change.
//!
//! WHAT THIS IS NOT. Authored stations survive, because some queues
//! are not implied by any step constraint. `my-watchlist` is the
//! worked example — "packets I filed" is not a step constraint and
//! never will be — and `loading-dock` is the train's dock, an
//! operational bundling point rather than a protocol fact. The
//! projection therefore ADDS to the registry rather than replacing it,
//! and a derived station never silently overwrites an authored row of
//! the same name (see [`derived_stations`]).
