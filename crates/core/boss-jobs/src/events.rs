//! NATS event subjects for the jobs domain.
//!
//! Two layers:
//!
//! - **State events** carry full row state and are what the
//!   audit_log → projection rebuild path consumes. Every Job or
//!   Step mutation emits exactly one: `JOB_CREATED`, `JOB_UPDATED`,
//!   `STEP_CREATED`, `STEP_UPDATED`. The payload is a serialized
//!   `Job` / `Step` — the rebuilder reproduces the projection by
//!   replaying these in audit_log id order.
//! - **Marker events** are informational signals for downstream
//!   consumers (dispatcher rule registry, UI badges, integrations).
//!   They duplicate state already in the sibling state event but
//!   give consumers a topic to filter on without payload matching.
//!   Rebuilder ignores them.

// State events — projections rebuild from these.
