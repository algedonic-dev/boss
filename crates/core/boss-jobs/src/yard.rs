//! The yard status read-model — "what is the yard doing, and why?"
//! answered from live system-of-record data, server-side, in one shape.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The operating model is registry data, but until this
//! surface an operator learning where a train sat — and, when it was
//! stuck, WHY — had to SSH and read a journal or a step's metadata by
//! hand. On 2026-09-02 two merged trains sat four hours at the
//! playground-deploy step because the deploy had silently refused a
//! dirty tree; the reason was written to `deployed.metadata.deploy_blocked`
//! and read by nobody. This module surfaces that reason, and the rest of
//! the yard's live state, as a computed payload the SPA renders directly.
//!
//! PURE BY DESIGN. Everything here is a function of data already in the
//! record — pr-train Jobs and their steps, the loading-dock queue, the
//! cadence rows, the delivery policy. It invents no thresholds of its
//! own: the boarding predicate's numbers come from the cadence rows and
//! the alarm thresholds from the delivery policy, so the page shows
//! current registry truth rather than folklore. The HTTP handler
//! (`http::yard`) is a thin adapter that reads those rows and calls
//! [`build_status`]; the decision logic lives here where a test can pin
//! it without a database.
//!
//! NOT A SECOND CONDUCTOR. This describes the cadence rules and the
//! current dock depth so an operator can read "boards at 4 parked or
//! 06:00/18:00 UTC; 2 parked now". It deliberately does NOT reimplement
//! the conductor's claim/cooldown decision (`boss train cadence`'s
//! `due_window`) — duplicating that decision would be a second copy that
//! drifts from the one that actually boards trains. It reports the rule,
//! not the verdict.
