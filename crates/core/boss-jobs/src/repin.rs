//! WHAT A RE-PIN WRITES — the plan that makes a moved packet read the
//! version it was moved to (design 7cf202a9, answering backlog
//! 4347a1af).
//!
//! A packet stays on its admission version unless an actor explicitly
//! moves it, and the move is on the record. Before this module the door
//! (`POST /api/jobs/{id}/convert`) changed `jobs.workflow_version` and
//! nothing else, so it moved the envelope and not the text an executor
//! reads: a step row carries what materialisation copied onto it — its
//! `procedure` and the other `metadata_defaults`, its kind, its title,
//! its completion `fields` (which completion validates against, not the
//! spec), its sign-offs and assurance — and a step the target inserts
//! had no row at all. Measured on page-audit c0d2caf0 (pinned v1, active
//! v3, differing only in two pending procedures): the door would have
//! answered `converted: true` and changed nothing an executor reads
//! (backlog 1e973965). An interim car refused every such move; this is
//! the half that carries it.
//!
//! So a re-pin, per Q2:
//!
//! - RE-PROJECTS every step not yet finished (pending, ready, active)
//!   from the target version: the row columns the spec owns (kind,
//!   title, fields, sign-offs, assurance) and each projected metadata
//!   key the two versions disagree on.
//! - MATERIALISES every step the target inserts, pending, at its
//!   position; the caller's readiness pass promotes it like any other.
//! - LEAVES every completed (and skipped) step with the text it ran
//!   under. Only its `sort_order` may move, so the list stays in the
//!   target's order when a step is inserted ahead of it.
//!
//! A PROJECTED KEY SOMEONE HAS SINCE WRITTEN IS KEPT, AND NAMED. The
//! row's metadata is the projection PLUS whatever the executor wrote.
//! A key is replaced only while the row still holds exactly what the
//! admission version projected there; a key holding anything else is
//! the executor's, and overwriting it would destroy work on an active
//! step. It is kept, and the record lists it as `kept`, so a reader can
//! see the one place the moved packet still reads its old text rather
//! than discover it.
//!
//! Whether the move is SAFE is not decided here —
//! [`crate::protocol_conversion::convertibility_for_packet`] decides
//! that, and the door asks it first. This decides only what the move
//! writes. Everything here is pure; the handler does the I/O.
