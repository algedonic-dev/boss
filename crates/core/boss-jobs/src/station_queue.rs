//! Station queue evaluation — the pure half of the station registry
//! (stations.md, Q1/Q2 ratified): membership is DERIVED (a station is
//! a predicate over packet state, recomputed at read time — no
//! mutable current-station field), and ordering is a data-declared
//! discipline (`priority, then age` default).
//!
//! Everything in this module is a pure function of `(StationSpec
//! fields, packets)` — no I/O, no clock — so the queue an operator
//! sees is reproducible from the projection alone. The HTTP handler
//! (`http/stations.rs`) supplies the open-Job universe and renders
//! the [`StationQueue`] envelope.
