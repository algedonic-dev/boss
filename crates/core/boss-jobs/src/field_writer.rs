//! A key a human signs has one declared writer, and the server — not
//! the caller — says who that writer is (design f623e425, David
//! 2026-09-25; backlog 6c9183de).
//!
//! WHY. An ops-request's `approve` step carries the keys the runner
//! renders on the host — `plan`, `verb`, `host`, `args`,
//! `rendered_plan_sha256` — and a passkey stamp binds the step's whole
//! shape. Until this module any caller with Update on the step could
//! merge those keys, so the passkey could be asked to sign a plan the
//! runner never rendered. The runner's re-render and the ceremony
//! binding REFUSE a swap after the fact; nothing PREVENTED one.
//!
//! THE DECLARATION IS REGISTRY DATA. A Workflow row names the one
//! writer of a key on the field itself (`StepField::writer`, e.g.
//! `writer = "runner:ops"`); the field list is fixed at admission and
//! the step PUT refuses a body that changes it (b433bdf3), so the
//! declaration cannot be written away by the caller it binds. A step
//! with no declared writer answers exactly as before.
//!
//! WHO THE WRITER IS NEVER COMES FROM THE CALLER. The `x-boss-user` id
//! is self-asserted: every machine-door caller holds the same estate
//! token and can type `automation:ops-runner`. A rule keyed on that id
//! is design option D, rejected because a guard that LOOKS like
//! protection against the adversary the review named, and is not, is a
//! mostly-sure guard. So a declared writer is satisfied ONLY by a
//! [`CredentialedCaller`] request extension, which a client cannot set:
//! only a server-side door that resolved a presented credential inserts
//! one. Until that door is mounted (the credential kind, its broker
//! handler and the resolve step are the next cars of design f623e425),
//! no caller satisfies a declared writer, which is why no live protocol
//! declares one yet — the declaration lands on the ops-request row with
//! the credential delivery, never before it. The viability lint holds
//! that: a `writer` not in [`RESOLVABLE_PRINCIPALS`] is refused at
//! publish.
//!
//! THE HOST BINDING. A credential bound to a host writes only packets
//! whose `host` (job metadata) is that host — "a runner for host h
//! writes only requests whose host is h" — so the credential of one
//! runner cannot author the plan another host's runner is asked to run.
