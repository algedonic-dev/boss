//! A write to a completed step must be REFUSED, not accepted and dropped.
//!
//! THE DEFECT (packet 09576fab). `PUT /api/jobs/{id}/steps/{step_id}`
//! against a completed step returns 204 and silently discards the parts
//! of the write the row freezes. Both adapters freeze `status`,
//! `completed_on` and `metadata` on a terminal row — deliberately, so a
//! write merged against a stale pre-completion fetch cannot demote a
//! finished step — but the handler reports success either way, so a
//! caller cannot tell a write that landed from one that vanished.
//!
//! WHAT IT COST. Three cars' stale gate receipts were "repaired", the
//! API said 204 three times, the writes never happened, and the cars
//! were reported fixed while staying unboardable. It cost two more
//! corrections on 2026-08-27: an accepted `correct-the-record` verdict
//! could not be applied to the sentence it corrected, because that
//! sentence lives in a completed step's metadata — so the correction
//! had to be recorded on the job, beside the claim rather than on it.
//!
//! THE OPEN QUESTION THE PACKET ASKED, now answered: is any metadata on
//! a completed step legitimately mutable? No. The conductor's
//! `boarded_head` stamp — the one path that visibly works against
//! finished cars — writes JOB metadata via `merge_job_metadata`, not
//! step metadata (train.rs: `car.get("metadata")`). So the frozen set
//! can be refused wholesale.
//!
//! WHO REFUSES WHAT. The `status` half was already fixed, by a check
//! further down the same handler added for this defect (job 903e6b90).
//! This change covers only `completed_on` and `metadata`, the two
//! fields still being dropped in silence — and deliberately leaves
//! `status` alone so the existing, more specific message survives.
//! `a_demotion_still_gets_the_specific_message` pins that boundary.
//!
//! WHY NOT REFUSE EVERY WRITE TO A TERMINAL STEP. Because the freeze
//! exists to make racing writers harmless: dispatcher assign retries
//! and JetStream redeliveries re-PUT content that is already stored.
//! Those are no-ops today and must stay 204 — turning them into 409s
//! would convert a harmless redelivery into a loud failure. The refusal
//! is therefore scoped to a write that would actually CHANGE a frozen
//! field.
