//! The no-orphan-steps check, run over the registries a deployment
//! actually ships — design f5ebd2e1 resolution `no-orphan-steps`, car 1
//! (backlog 67a58840): a WARN with the count PINNED.
//!
//! "Every ready step in an open packet is selected by at least one
//! station predicate or carries an assignee ... computable from
//! registry data alone." So this reads registry data alone: the
//! platform Workflow bundle (`infra/platform/workflows/*.toml`, through
//! the same loader the seed uses), the station rows THE SCHEMA SHIPS
//! (`infra/postgres/schema/*.sql` applied to a scratch database and
//! read back through `PgStations::list_active`, never a hand-copied
//! predicate — CLAUDE.md 9a), and the constraint queues the projection
//! derives from the bundle — the same union `GET /api/stations` serves.
//!
//! WARN, NOT REFUSE, in this car. The design's open sub-question was
//! "warn or refuse": a refusal at publish needs the station set to be
//! complete first, and the measurement below says it is not. So the
//! list is PRINTED (an operator reading the test output sees every
//! orphan by protocol/step/kind) and the COUNT is pinned: a car that
//! adds an orphan reds this test and must say so; a car that covers
//! one moves the number DOWN here, which is the ratchet toward the
//! refusal. The next car flips `assert_eq!` to `assert!(is_empty())`
//! at the publish gate once every row below is covered.
//!
//! Measured 2026-09-15 against origin/main 82be5b64 (48 platform kinds,
//! 268 steps, 117 of them a person's work, 14 stations authored +
//! derived): the count below. Notably
//! `approval/decide` — an `answer-question` decision with no authority,
//! no station and no assignee — is exactly the class the design's own
//! instance belonged to; and several `task` steps here are in practice
//! completed by the ops runner (`ops_verb` in their defaults) or the
//! gate runner, which is a declaration the registry cannot yet make
//! (an `individual` audience naming the automation is the shape for
//! it, once those actors are registered).
