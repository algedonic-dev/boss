/// `authority_role = platform-admin` and no assignee at birth, so the
/// dispatcher's executes-lane (`BOSS_DISPATCH_EXECUTOR_ID`, roles
/// `platform-admin`) nominated each one to `claude@algedonic.dev`, and
/// the conductor then completed it. Seven steps per train in the
/// agent's MY WORK, every ~45 minutes, none of them the agent's. A bare
/// `authority_role` with no assignee is not the fix either: the
/// assignment query's role arm lists such a step for EVERY holder of
/// the role, so it would have reached David's queue as claimable work
/// instead. The step is the conductor's; the record should say so.
