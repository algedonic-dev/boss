//! The platform station bundle (`infra/platform/stations/`) declares
//! exactly the ACTIVE rows the migrations produce — every column — and
//! can be the registry's only home.
//!
//! MEASURED 2026-09-18 on origin/main 1a09f660 (backlog 393d3234,
//! consolidation H4, car 1 of 4). Seven migrations were the only place
//! a platform station was declared: 116 seeded `loading-dock` and
//! `design-review`, 118 `my-watchlist`, 124 `repair`, 130 / 133 /
//! 20260910201453 bumped two of them, 20260915023614 authored
//! `q.platform-admin.task`, and 119 / 138 / 139 / 202609101900 UPDATEd
//! columns in place. A migration is the wrong home for a registry row:
//! it runs once, a fresh instance cannot re-declare it without replaying
//! history, nothing drift-checks it against the live row, and every
//! edit is a contended timestamped file. Dispatcher rules left that
//! shape on 2026-09-11 and the Workflow bundle before them; this is the
//! same move for stations.
//!
//! TWO PINS, in the order the move needs them:
//!
//!   1. The bundle is COMPLETE before it becomes the home: the active
//!      rows a TestDb holds after the migrations equal the rows the
//!      bundle declares, name for name and column for column
//!      (`created_at` excepted — it is when the deployment was built,
//!      not part of the declaration).
//!   2. The bundle can be the ONLY home: with the `stations` table
//!      emptied, the seed's publish function recreates the migration
//!      rows exactly — same versions, same columns, active.
//!
//! And the refusal that makes editing safe: a bundle row that differs
//! from the live active row of the same (name, version) is refused by
//! name and field, and the live row is left untouched. A version bump
//! is the edit path, as it is for workflows.
