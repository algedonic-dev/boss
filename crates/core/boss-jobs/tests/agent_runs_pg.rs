//! Postgres-backed coverage for the two token shapes a run can report.
//!
//! The in-memory port test proves the CONTRACT; this file proves the
//! SCHEMA, and the two halves of that are different claims:
//!
//!   * a run that reports only a total can be stored at all — which it
//!     could not before 20260910151729, because `input_tokens` and
//!     `output_tokens` were `NOT NULL` and no coding agent on this pod
//!     has a split to put in them;
//!   * the total and the split cannot drift apart in the table, because
//!     the writer derives one from the other and a CHECK refuses any
//!     row that disagrees. §9a asks for a collapse where one is
//!     possible and a pin where it is not; Postgres cannot GENERATE
//!     `total_tokens` (a generated column could not then be supplied
//!     for a total-only run), so the pin is the constraint, and a pin
//!     nobody tests is a comment.
//!
//! The raw INSERTs below are deliberate: they go around the Rust
//! writer, which is the only way to ask whether the DATABASE refuses a
//! malformed row or merely trusts its callers.
