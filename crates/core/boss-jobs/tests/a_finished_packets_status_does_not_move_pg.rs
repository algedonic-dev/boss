//! Both adapters refuse to move a finished packet's status (backlog
//! 570e72bd, road 5).
//!
//! The job PUT's reopen refusal read the row, judged it, then wrote the
//! whole row back: a close that committed between the read and the
//! write — the terminal close, the catch-all, another operator — was
//! overwritten, and the packet came back open with its outcome erased.
//! The handler cannot close that window from where it stands; the
//! storage can, because it is the one place that sees the row as it is
//! when the write lands. So `update_job_at` is a compare-and-set on a
//! finished status: a Closed or Cancelled row keeps its status, and a
//! write that would move it is refused as `TerminalJob` — never
//! answered as if it had landed. One body of assertions runs against
//! each adapter, so the two cannot drift apart (CLAUDE.md §9a).
