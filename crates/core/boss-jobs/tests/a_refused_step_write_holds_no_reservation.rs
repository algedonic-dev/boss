//! A refused step write holds no calendar reservation, and its re-send
//! is not refused against one.
//!
//! Review of car 88123ae0 (backlog 558396ff, 2026-09-25). The step PUT
//! reserves the assignee's time (`calendar_hook::apply_step_transition`)
//! BEFORE it writes the step, so a hard conflict can refuse the write
//! with nothing stored. Since 88123ae0 the write itself can also be
//! refused — 409 `step_changed` (`STEP_CHANGED_CODE`), nothing
//! written, send it again. But the reservation had already been made:
//! the refused write left it behind, and the re-send's own reservation
//! then collided with it and was refused "calendar conflict" — against
//! the step's own residue, forever.
//!
//! The first repair released every hold keyed on the step — before each
//! start, and again after each refused write — and the review of car
//! 983696b5 held it: a racing start that LANDED holds the same key, so a
//! refused racer erased the landed start's hold and left an Active step
//! holding nothing. Every compensation now undoes only what its own
//! attempt did: a refused write cancels its reservation by id, a start
//! that finds the step's own hold on its exact time takes it rather than
//! replacing it, and a skip releases only once its write has landed.
//!
//! The round-2 review held it again, on the same race in the reverse
//! order: the refused racer's reservation WAS the hold a landed start
//! had taken as its own, so handing it back by id still left the Active
//! step holding nothing. The row as stored now decides: a refused start
//! keeps its reservation when the step is Active over that time, and a
//! start that landed on a hold it did not place re-asserts it.
//!
//! The calendar here is a small stateful adapter with the service's one
//! rule that matters (a subject holds one hard reservation per
//! overlapping window), not the call-recording fake: the defect is in
//! what the calendar HOLDS after the refusal, which a fake that forgets
//! every reservation cannot show.
