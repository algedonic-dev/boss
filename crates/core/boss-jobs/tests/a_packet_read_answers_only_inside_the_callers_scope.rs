//! A packet read answers only inside the caller's read scope.
//!
//! Backlog 046832d3 (found by the triage of e5f7b51e, measured at
//! origin/main 9df57797): `GET /api/jobs` scoped its rows by policy, and
//! every job WRITE ran `policy.check` plus `scope_matches` on the row —
//! but six READS took no `CurrentUser` at all and answered any caller in
//! full: the detail (`/api/jobs/{id}`), its audit slice (`/events`), its
//! SSE stream (`/stream`), its steps (`/steps`), the assignments queue
//! (`/api/jobs/assignments`, including `all_assigned=true`) and the
//! refused-step-write table (`/api/jobs/step-write-refusals`). An
//! anonymous caller — no `x-boss-user`, so role `guest`, which the
//! policy grants only `workflow` Read — read every packet it could name,
//! and the ids were discoverable without auth.
//!
//! Each route now asks the list's question per row: policy Read on
//! `job`, then is THIS packet inside the scope it granted. A caller the
//! policy denies is REFUSED (403) before any id is looked up, so the
//! refusal says nothing about the id; a packet outside a granted scope
//! answers the SAME 404 as a packet that does not exist, so a scoped
//! caller cannot probe for ids either. Collections keep only the rows
//! inside scope.
//!
//! A HEADERLESS request is the `guest` the extractor defaults to, and is
//! refused here exactly as the list hands it nothing — whether a
//! headerless caller should be TRUSTED is backlog e84de48e's decision,
//! and `trust::is_trusted` is deliberately untouched.
//!
//! THE CALLER'S OWN WORK IS THE EXCEPTION, AND ONE RULE DECIDES IT
//! (review of 0c0405ac, 2026-09-25). A step handed to the caller, or
//! claimable by the role the caller holds, is theirs to see and to
//! open even on a packet they do not own — the queue shows the row and
//! the packet read admits the packet, so a row can never name a packet
//! that then answers 404. The first cut kept only assigned rows, which
//! emptied My Day's claimable pool for every `self`- or
//! territory-scoped role, and left the rows it did keep unopenable.
//!
//! DEPARTMENT SCOPE, as `scope_matches` and the list both read it, is
//! judged on the CALLER's department, not the packet's: a caller granted
//! `department:brewhouse` who is in brewhouse reads every packet, one in
//! another department reads none. The tests below hold that, rather
//! than a per-packet department nobody's scope check reads today.
