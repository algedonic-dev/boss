//! The platform Workflow seed inserts what is missing and touches

//! protocols-as-data Q1, as David answered it: "the seed binary inserts

//! goes away deliberately: it is the feature that reverts operator
//! edits." Both halves are load-bearing and both are asserted here —
//! the insert, and the not-touching.
