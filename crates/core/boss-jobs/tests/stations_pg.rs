//! Postgres-backed coverage for the station registry
//! (116-stations.sql, 118-watchlist-station.sql, 124-repair-station.sql):

//! - the platform seed ships the SDLC batch stations and the filer's
//!   watchlist, active, with predicates the evaluator can actually
//!   parse (a seed row the Rust shape rejects would be a silent dead
//!   station);
//! - every registry write stages its event in `event_outbox` in the
//!   SAME transaction as the stations row (the workflow-registry
//!   posture; the InMemory contract is pinned in `stations::tests`);
//! - every `jobs.station.*` kind is registered in `event_kinds` so the
//!   audit trigger admits it. Deliberately an exact-set assertion
//!   rather than a contains-check: a marker emitted but never
