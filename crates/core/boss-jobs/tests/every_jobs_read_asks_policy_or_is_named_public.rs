//! Every read the jobs API serves asks policy, or is named public with
//! a reason (backlog e5f7b51e, 2026-09-26).
//!
//! WHY IT EXISTS. `/ics/{*rest}` is mounted sessionless onto the jobs
//! upstream on every instance, so until the gateway's dot-segment fix
//! (1d9b7db7) `GET /ics/%2e%2e/api/<path>` reached this service with no
//! `x-boss-user` — and so does anything reaching the jobs port directly
//! (2710c8fc). The triage of this item measured 64 GET routes on
//! origin/main 9df57797 and found 24 that consulted nothing: full
//! packets, their audit slices, the assignments queue, employee
//! schedules. Those were fixed one door at a time (046832d3, e84de48e,
//! a621d091, 7ae9ccec, 19f08bd6); nothing held the NEXT door to the
//! same rule. This pin does.
//!
//! THE ROUTE LIST IS DERIVED, NOT TYPED (CLAUDE.md §9a). It is read out
//! of the router source the service binary assembles: the binary's
//! `router_shared` and every `boss_jobs::<module>::http::router` it
//! merges, and within each, every `.route(` whose method router carries
//! a `get(`. A GET added to any of them is in this test's list the
//! moment it is written. A router the binary merges that this test does
//! not also mount answers the test's fallback (418), and fails naming
//! the route — so a new module cannot slip past by not being assembled
//! here.
//!
//! THE JUDGEMENT IS MEASURED, NOT READ FROM THE HANDLER. Each route is
//! requested exactly as the anonymous caller arrives — no headers at
//! all — against a router with every optional port wired (an unwired
//! port answers 503 before most handlers reach their check, which would
//! say nothing about the door). A route passes when it REFUSES that
//! caller (401 / 403), or when it ASKED the policy engine while
//! answering (a recording client counts every `check` and
//! `scope_predicate`; the engine behind it denies everything, so a
//! scoped read answers from an empty scope). Anything else must sit on
//! one of the two lists below:
//!
//! - [`PUBLIC`]: sessionless by design, each with its reason. A row
//!   that starts asking policy fails the test — it is not public any
//!   more, so the list must not say it is.
//! - [`PENDING`]: a RATCHET. The reads that still answer an anonymous
//!   caller unasked, measured at this car, each naming why it is not
//!   yet fixed. It may only shrink: a pending route that now asks fails
//!   the test until its row is deleted, and a new route cannot be added
//!   without a reviewer reading the row that adds it.
//!
//! Both lists are held to the derived set: a row naming a route the
//! router no longer serves as a GET fails, so neither list outlives its
//! routes.
