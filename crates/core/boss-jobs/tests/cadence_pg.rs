//! Postgres-backed coverage for the cadence registry surface.
//!
//! This file inherits a specific scar. Until 2026-08-14 the train
//! conductor opened its own `PgPool` and read `cadence_rules`
//! directly. It ran on a host whose local Postgres was NOT the
//! cluster's, so the registry an operator inspected said
//! `min_dock_depth = 4` while the loop actually enforcing boarding
//! read 8 — and a confident, sourced, wrong answer came out of that
//! gap ("the dock is at 4, it will board"). It did not board.
//!
//! The seed assertion below is the pin from the SERVING side: the
//! number the API hands the conductor is the number in the schema. The
//! conductor no longer has a second opinion available to it, because it
//! no longer has a second database.
