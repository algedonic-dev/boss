/// that stamps `Utc::now()` server-side (with a platform-automation
/// event stamp — test-path ergonomics), and an `_at` variant that
/// takes an explicit timestamp plus the caller's [`EventStamp`] so
/// the projection write and the audit_log event share one timestamp —
/// required for the audit_log → projection rebuild path. See
/// `docs/design/projection-rebuilders.md`.
///
/// OUTBOX (phase 2): every mutation records its domain event on the
/// transactional outbox INSIDE the adapter transaction via the
/// stamp (`boss_events::outbox::record_event_in_tx`);
/// boss-event-relay delivers to audit_log + NATS post-commit.
/// Nothing publishes post-commit.
