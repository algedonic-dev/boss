//! HTTP client port for reaching the boss-people service.
//!
//! Several domain services need to ask people questions as part of
//! their own write guards — "does this employee actually exist
//! before we accept an event with their actor_id?", "does this
//! account actually exist before we create an opportunity targeting
//! it?". We express those as trait methods so production code can
//! call the real people HTTP API while tests substitute a fake.
//!
//! Mirror of `boss-assets-client`. The trait and reqwest adapter live
//! in this crate so both `boss-assets` and `boss-commerce` can depend
//! on one shared definition without creating awkward cross-domain
//! crate dependencies.
