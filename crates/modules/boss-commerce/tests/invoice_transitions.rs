//! The invoice status transitions, one contract run against BOTH
//! adapters (backlog 203ef806).
//!
//! Three verbs move an invoice — mark paid, mark past-due, write off —
//! and until this pin each adapter decided for itself which invoices
//! they accept. Pg's past-due flip had no guard at all, so a paid or
//! written-off invoice could be flipped back to past-due and re-enter
//! the receivable (a conservation break: the money was already out of
//! 1100 A/R). Pg wrote off only outstanding|past-due while the
//! in-memory adapter refused only paid, and the in-memory paid and
//! past-due verbs changed nothing at all.
//!
//! The table below is written out as data, deliberately NOT derived
//! from `InvoiceStatus::transition_to`: a contract computed from the
//! rule it checks proves nothing. Every cell is run on both adapters,
//! and each observes three things — the verb's answer, the status the
//! invoice is left in, and how many of the verb's events were recorded
//! (one on a flip; none on a redelivery or a refusal).
