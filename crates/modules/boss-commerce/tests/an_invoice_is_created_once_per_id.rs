//! An invoice is created once per id — one contract, run against BOTH
//! adapters (backlog 9d2af748).
//!
//! `create_invoice_at` recorded `commerce.invoice.created` on EVERY
//! call. The Pg adapter's `ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE` overwrote the
//! header, deleted and re-inserted the lines, and recorded the event
//! again; only `finance.invoice.issued` was protected, by the unique
//! (kind, source) fact index. The event is what the dispatcher's
//! `products-consume-on-invoice-created` rule reacts to, so a second
//! create under one id could drive a second finished-goods consume — a
//! conservation break, not a duplicate log row. And the overwrite put
//! the body's status back: a redelivered issue (the dispatcher's
//! `commerce.invoice.issue` re-POSTs the same `outstanding` body when
//! its event is redelivered) turned a PAID invoice owed again.
//!
//! Each adapter is held to four things: a repeat of the same body
//! writes nothing and records nothing; it answers the invoice as
//! stored, and says it was already created; a repeat after the invoice
//! moved (paid) leaves it where it moved to — status and `paid_on` are
//! the verbs' to write, not the create's; and a body that differs from
//! the stored invoice in anything fixed at issuance is refused by name.
