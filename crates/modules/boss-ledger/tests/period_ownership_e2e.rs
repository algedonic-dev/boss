//! Which period owns a journal entry — and the two paths agreeing on it.
//!
//! The ledger is a projection of the fact log, so replaying the log
//! must reproduce the live ledger exactly. It did not: a year-end
//! close posted live landed in the **yearly** period (deliberately —
//! `insert_closing_entry` exists for that), while replaying the same
//! fact ran through `ensure_period_for`, which knew only about months
//! and filed it under December.
//!
//! Nothing was wrong with the money. The nightly deep replay-check
//! reported `fact_divergences=0, entry_divergences=1`, and the one
//! entry was "only-in-replay" — the live copy existed, in a different
//! period. Live excluded it from the comparison because the year was
//! locked; replay included it because December was open. The first
//! year-end close ever posted was what surfaced it.
//!
//! The rule now lives in one place, `owning_period_kind`, which both
//! paths consult. These tests pin that, and pin the SQL copy of it
//! against the Rust one.
