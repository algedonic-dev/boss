//! Revenue-recognition scheduler — step 3 of the ASC-606 design.
//!
//! Reads `revenue_schedules` rows whose `next_recognition_date` is due,
//! emits a `finance.revenue.recognized` fact per period (RuleSet v2 then
//! posts the corresponding journal entry: DR 2200 / CR <revenue-account>),
//! advances the cursor, and flips the status to `closed` once the
//! schedule is fully recognized.
//!
//! Pure-vs-impure split: period math + cursor advancement + amount
//! computation live in free functions with no DB touch (testable in
//! isolation). The `run_tick` entry point is the only async function,
//! doing the actual transaction + fact insert + `post_fact_in_tx`
//! hand-off. Locked-period behavior: skip
//! forward to the next open month, attach a `makeup_for` marker so
//! auditors can trace the original-vs-realized period.
//!
//! Idempotency: `financial_facts` is uniquely indexed on
//! `(kind, source_table, source_id)`. We set `source_id =
//! "{schedule_id}::{period_start}"` so re-running the tick for the same
//! schedule + period is a no-op. The cursor advance happens in the same
//! transaction as the fact insert, so either both land or neither does.
