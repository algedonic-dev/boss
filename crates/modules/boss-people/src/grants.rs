//! How a people read or write meets policy — one place, so the
//! roster, the single row and the change log ask the same question
//! the same way.
//!
//! Backlog 8cdad84c (2026-09-23): the live people-api ran with
//! `policy: None`, so the employee Update gate was skipped in
//! production, and the change log (`/api/people/changes`,
//! `/api/people/{id}/changes`) made no policy call at all — read or
//! write — while its rows can carry pay in `from_value` / `to_value`.
//! The binary now wires the policy client; this module is what every
//! surface that touches an employee row asks.
