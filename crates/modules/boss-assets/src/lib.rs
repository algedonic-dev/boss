//! BOSS assets domain — serial-numbered physical assets + their
//! append-only event logs.
//!
//! Every physical unit that enters Boss's custody is a `Asset` identified
//! by a `AssetId`. Its full life — custody (Received → Triage →
//! Refurb → QA → Ready), commerce (Sold → Shipped → Installed →
//! WarrantyStarted), and service (TicketOpened/Closed, PartReplaced,
//! Decommissioned) — lives in one append-only `AssetEvent` log.
//!
//! `AssetCurrentState` is a projection from that log, rebuildable at any
//! time. The log is the source of truth; current state is a summary.
//!
//! Hexagonal: the domain defines `AssetsRepository` (a port). Postgres,
//! in-memory, NATS-backed adapters all implement the same trait.
