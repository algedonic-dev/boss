//! Domain event subjects for inventory operations.
//!
//! Two-layer split (same shape as boss-jobs):
//!
//! - **State events** carry full row state and are what the
//!   audit_log → projection rebuild path consumes.
//! - **Marker events** are informational signals for downstream
//!   consumers (low-stock alerts, status badges). They duplicate
//!   state already in the sibling state event but give consumers
//!   a topic to filter on without payload matching. Rebuild
//!   ignores them.

// Vendors — state events carry full Vendor row state.
// vendor.deleted carries `{id, deleted_at}` (the rebuild's signal
// to omit the row).
