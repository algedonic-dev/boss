// Did this read work, and what is the page therefore allowed to say?
//
// THE CLASS THIS EXISTS FOR (packet 7a7bfc88, measured 2026-09-20). One
// line, live once per page in six pages beyond /ux/support:
//
//   const pBody = pResp.ok ? await pResp.json() : [];            // 5 pages
//   devicesPage = dPaged.kind === 'ready' ? dPaged.page : null;  // AccountsList
//
// A non-2xx becomes an empty list, or a `failed` arm is dropped on the
// floor, and the page paints an outage as its normal empty state: no
// banner, no alert, nothing for an operator to notice. Silence is the
// one forbidden failure mode and each of those lines manufactures it.
//
// WHY A MODULE IN data/ RATHER THAN SIX MORE FIXES. The support page
// fixed exactly this in apps/web/src/support/reads.ts and the fix
// works, but it is one idea, and six copies of one idea is the drift
// CLAUDE.md 9a is about. The general shape is small: a ReadState per
// read, and a view that refuses to let a failure wear the empty state.
// Lifted here it is one definition with one test, and adopting a page
// is mechanical — `readStateOfResponse` / `readStateOf` at the fetch,
// `listView` at the empty state, `blankMeaning` at a blank cell.
//
// WHY NOT Remote<T> (data/remote.ts). Remote carries the DATA of a read
// that is still in flight; ReadState is the residue of a read whose
// data has already been folded into derived rows. The pages in this
// class keep the rows and forget the outcome, which is precisely the
// bug, so the outcome needs a name of its own that survives beside the
// rows. Use Remote when the component holds the payload; use ReadState
// when it holds what the payload became.

/// One read's outcome. A failure carries its reason, because the
/// operator reading the page is the person who has to act on it.
