// A department's jobs view — in / working / out over the packets whose
// workflow declares the department.
//
// David, 2026-09-12: "each department will have a view of jobs flowing
// in, jobs getting worked within the department, and jobs flowing
// out." IT built its three first (Receiving Yard / Crew Board / Train
// Yard), each IT-shaped. This is the department-shaped instance: one
// read, three thirds, for every department the Class registry declares
// — the tab a surface-less department used to land on All jobs from
// (backlog cc76f755, 2026-09-18).
//
// WHICH PACKETS ARE THE DEPARTMENT'S is the server's question, not
// this file's: `GET /api/jobs?department=<code>` narrows to the kinds
// whose active workflow row declares `metadata.department = <code>`.
// A packet carries no department; its workflow does. Before that
// parameter existed the listing ignored it and answered the
// unfiltered count (1944 on prod), which is the reading this page
// must never make — so the loader keeps `total` and the page reports
// a truncated read rather than calling a page the world.
//
// WHICH THIRD A PACKET IS IN is derived here, from its steps, and the
// rule is deliberately the plainest one that is true:
//
//   out      — terminal (closed or cancelled). The read asks for the
//              last OUT_WINDOW_DAYS of them, so this third is "what
//              left recently", not the archive.
//   in       — live, and nothing has been done on it yet: no step has
//              started or finished. It stands at its first step.
//   working  — live, and something has: a step is active, or one has
//              completed and the next is waiting.
//
// A packet whose kind has no steps is inbound until it closes; a
// blocked packet is working (something happened, then it stopped).
// "First HUMAN step" — skipping past automated admission steps — is
// the sharper reading and needs the step's actor on the wire, which
// the listing does not carry; this rule is the honest first cut and
// says so.
