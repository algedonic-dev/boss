// The nav catalog is the single source of truth for which app owns a
// surface. These tests hold two lines.
//
// First, the de-duplication that made the app split safe: app
// membership used to live in two sets, in two vocabularies, in two
// files (AppShell's `MODEL_ROUTES: Set<RouteName>` for the sidebar,
// App.svelte's `MODEL_KINDS: Set<Route['kind']>` for the active tab),
// which had to agree for every routed surface or a page rendered under
// the wrong tab with nothing failing. That membership set is still
// pinned verbatim against the deleted list — it now belongs to the IT
// app rather than a top-level System Model tab, but which surfaces
// travel together has not changed.
//
// Second, the split itself: every surface belongs to exactly one app,
// every app the tab bar advertises can actually be reached, and no
// surface is stranded in an app with no tab.
