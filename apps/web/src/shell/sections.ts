// Which sidebar section highlights for each route kind — and, through
// `appForSection`, which app tab the page renders under.
//
// This was a 60-line ternary inside App.svelte. It moved out for the
// same two reasons the nav catalog itself moved out of AppShell:
//
//  1. Exhaustiveness is now the type system's job. The ternary's
//     fall-through shipped 21 of 74 kinds rendering inside the Home
//     chrome, and the test guarding it had to scrape the Svelte source
//     with regexes. `Record<Route['kind'], string>` makes a missing
//     kind a typecheck failure instead.
//
//  2. The section ids on the right-hand side are ROUTE_CATALOG keys —
//     the same string must exist there for the sidebar row to
//     highlight and for `appForSection` to find the owning app. That
//     agreement was unpinned, and it drifted: 'systemMonitoring' and
//     'systemStepPlugins' (camelCase route kinds used as section ids)
//     miss their kebab-case catalog keys, so /it/operate/audit — the
//     IT tab's own landing page — rendered under Home chrome.
//     `sections.test.ts` pins every value now (CLAUDE.md §9a).
