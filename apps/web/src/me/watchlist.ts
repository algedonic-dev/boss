// The filer's watchlist — the packets I filed, and what became of
// them.
//
// Origin (David, 2026-08-13): "Once the user feedback results in
// either a shipped change or some other terminal state, it can be
// closed without the filer approving. But, we should always notify the
// filer with the terminal state and it should show in their
// watchlist."
//
// This is a station lens, not a bespoke read: the whole surface is
// `GET /api/stations/my-watchlist/queue`, one registry row whose
// predicate is `metadata_equals: {submitted_by: "@me"}` and whose
// `@me` the server binds to the requesting actor. So the queue this
// module renders is derived membership over the caller's own
// policy-scoped packets — the same machinery every other queue lens
// reads through, with no per-person rows anywhere.
//
// Not to be confused with `accounts/WatchlistPage.svelte` at
// `/watchlist` — that is the account CHURN watchlist, a different
// domain and a different noun. "Watchlist" here is David's own word
// for the filer's receipt, and this one is scoped to a person, which
// is why it lives on My Day rather than at a route of its own.
//
// Two things this lens deliberately does NOT do:
//   - re-sort. Ordering is the station's declared discipline
//     (`recency` — newest activity first), and two orderings of one
//     queue is one too many.
//   - infer an outcome. The terminal state is read off the packet's
//     own `metadata.outcome`, which the terminal close stamps. A
//     closed packet with nothing recorded says "closed", because that
//     is the whole of what is known.
