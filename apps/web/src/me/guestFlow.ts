// What happened to the feedback guests sent — as packets standing at
// stations, which is what they actually are.
//
// Origin (David, feedback cef0f06f): "We need a better Guest landing
// experience. It should welcome people to Algedonic Ales, introduce
// them to the guest experience, and I think it would be cool if we
// could show how Guest feedback has been flowing through the real IT
// department to add functionality as we go." Then, on the first cut:
// "I think the Guest landing looks too much like an employee view
// still ... I think we show that more as job cards moving through
// stations instead of just a static list."
//
// The first version was a table of rows in the instrument idiom — the
// yard's language, aimed at an operator who already knows what a
// station is. A visitor does not. So the same truth is rendered as
// motion: a short track of stops, and each piece of feedback standing
// at the one it has reached.
//
// The claim this makes is unusual and worth making carefully: the
// feedback control in the bar does not file a ticket into a void — it
// opens a Job that moves through the same stations, protocols and
// trains as every other piece of work here. That is only worth showing
// if it is TRUE, so nothing below invents a stop, rounds a count, or
// quietly drops the feedback that was turned down.
