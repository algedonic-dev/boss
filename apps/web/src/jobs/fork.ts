// Reading a queue's fork out of the Workflow registry, and finding the
// step that carries it on a given Job.
//
// This lives in one module because it has already drifted once. The
// terminal queue reader found the triage step by matching a step KIND
// while the board had moved to finding it by its authority gate, and
// the two disagreed the same day — the reader reported a freshly filed
// item as already triaged. CLAUDE.md §9a: a fact that lives twice gets
// an equality test, or it gets collapsed. This is the collapse.
//
// Everything here derives from registry data. Nothing hardcodes a
// disposition, a step kind, or a field name: add a disposition to the
// Workflow and the callers pick it up with no change.
