  // A queue of Jobs parked on a human, as a board.
  //
  // Columns come from the Workflow, not from this file. A triage step
  // that forks declares its dispositions as an inline enum field, and
  // each disposition has a successor step gated on it — so the board
  // renders one column per route the workflow actually offers, labelled
  // with that successor's own title. Add a disposition to the registry
  // and the column appears; nothing here changes.
  //
  // That is the whole point of the redesign. The first version had
  // three hardcoded columns ending in "Triaged", which made triage a
  // synonym for closing. Triage's real output is a decision about what
  // happens next, so dropping a card into a column IS choosing that
  // route: it completes the fork step with that disposition, which
  // makes the corresponding next step ready.
  //
  // Columns therefore remain STEP STATE, never a stored field. A
  // Step's `status` is the program counter of the state machine, so a
  // card cannot disagree with the Job behind it.
  //
  // The agent hand-off is an annotation on an untriaged card rather
  // than a column: an agent taking a first pass is not a disposition,
  // and treating it as one was the modelling error. It records a
  // durable request rather than firing something — it survives a
  // reload, and an agent taking an automatic first pass later writes
  // the same record with no human clicking.
