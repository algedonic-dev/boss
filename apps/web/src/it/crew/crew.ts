// The Crew Board's read model — the MIDDLE third of the operator
// surface (backlog 04c5bbc0, answered by David 2026-09-11).
//
// The Train Yard shows the last third of a car's life and the
// Marshalling Yard shows the first. This shows the interval in between,
// which had no surface at all: an actor building something, while it
// happens. Prototype on a real snapshot, 2026-09-08:
// https://claude.ai/code/artifact/36b9a721-73fb-49f8-bb7d-701c43da76a5
//
// NO NUMBER THIS SURFACE MAKES UP. The rule the Marshalling Yard's
// module states and this one inherits. Every figure below is folded out
// of a payload measured against the system of record on 2026-09-11:
// `/api/yard/status`, `/api/jobs?kind=ship-a-change`,
// `/api/jobs?kind=gate-run` and `/api/jobs/queue-age`. Where a figure
// cannot be counted it is `null` and the page renders the reason — never
// a zero, which on a board about who is working reads as "nobody is".
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT: the prototype's writes-per-hour strip.
// David's decision put the audit tail last, "behind whatever the
// events-readability decision turns out to be... If the audit tail is
// the blocker, ship the board without the writes strip rather than
// waiting for it." Measured 2026-09-11: `/api/events/*` is served by
// boss-events-api behind the gateway's auth-gated proxy and answers 401
// without a browser session; `TailQuery` has no actor parameter, the
// per-actor identity lives only inside `payload._actor`, `limit` is
// clamped to 500, and `/api/events/stats` breaks down by day and kind
// and not by actor. A per-actor rate here could only be fabricated, so
// it is absent. `crew.test.ts` pins its absence.
