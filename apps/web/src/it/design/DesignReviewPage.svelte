  // /it/design — the design-review station, rendered.
  //
  // This page is a LENS: the packets are the `design-review` station's
  // evaluated queue, and the page's own identity (header, panel set)
  // is the `lens` its registry row declares. It used to define the
  // queue itself — `/api/jobs?kind=design-doc-review&status=open`
  // filtered in the browser — which is two definitions of one queue,
  // drifting silently. See `designLens.ts` for the full reasoning.
  //
  // IT IS NOW ONLY THAT, and the change is a deletion. The page used
  // to render a second thing beside the queue: a table of the markdown
  // files under docs/design/, read from the corpus endpoint on
  // boss-docs-api, with a button that opened a `design-doc-review` Job
  // per file. That service and the corpus index behind it were deleted
  // on 2026-09-10 (backlog f5da586c) — the packet is the doc, so a
  // list of files is not a list of work.
  //
  // What that removed was not only dead code. The corpus table WAS the
  // page; the queue was fetched and then used for nothing a reader
  // could see, because the only consumer was a join on `subject.id` =
  // doc path, and a `design-doc` packet's subject is the literal
  // `boss-platform`. So the station's real packets — the design docs
  // actually waiting on a decision — rendered nowhere, while files
  // nobody had filed anything about rendered as rows with a Start
  // button. The page now shows the queue it was always fetching.
