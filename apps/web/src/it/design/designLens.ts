// The design-review lens — /system/design as a view onto a station's
// queue rather than a page with its own idea of what that queue is.
//
// Origin (David, feedback 3f5f7f63): "the Design Review page should
// really just be a custom view onto a particular queue or set of
// queues. That is what many of our pages fundamentally devolve into.
// Here is what is in queue, presented usefully, with context about how
// that queue has been flowing recently."
//
// WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT IS NOT COSMETIC
// The page used to define its own queue in the browser —
// `/api/jobs?kind=design-doc-review&status=open` filtered client-side —
// while the `design-review` station defined the same queue as a
// predicate the server evaluates. A client filter and a station's
// evaluated queue are two different definitions of one queue, and they
// drift silently: a packet the station holds can be missing from the
// page that exists to show it. Reading `GET /api/stations/
// design-review/queue` makes the registry row the single definition.
//
// The page's own identity (header, which panels it carries) comes from
// the same envelope, off `stations.lens` — the shape `upstream` proved
// in 119: the row declares it, the queue echoes it, the lens renders
// whatever the row says.
