// Which design docs are actually asking for something, and which are
// just claiming to.
//
// Origin (David, feedback bedda461): "This page is full of stale info.
// What I expected: the page only includes active jobs and maybe a link
// to the Design Library / Flattened ADR representation of the current
// system."
//
// MEASURED, 38 docs indexed, 2026-08-15: the page's "In review &
// discussion" section held 23 docs. ELEVEN of them had zero open
// questions, zero pending decisions and no open review Job. They were
// there because a hand-written `**Status**:` line still said in-review
// or draft.
//
// The old rule (2026-07-08) was "status says so OR anything actionable
// is attached", and it was right for the corpus it was written
// against. What changed is that the corpus grew a long tail of
// finished discussions — because the status line is the one input to
// that rule nobody ever updates. Answering a doc's last question is a
// flush; the flush rewrites Decision history and never touches the
// frontmatter. So status drifts to stale by default, in one direction,
// and the section fills with settled work.
//
// So the rule inverts: a doc is asking for something when something is
// OPEN. Status becomes a label rather than a gate — kept visible,
// because it still says what the author intended, just not trusted to
// decide what is on your plate. The cause is filed separately
// (`0b8ae875`); fixing the page is not fixing the mechanism.
