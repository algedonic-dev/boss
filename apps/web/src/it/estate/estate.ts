// HARDCODED, and loudly so, for the same reason the VIP was: the
// hostname is DECLARED — the tunnel route in
// infra/cluster/tunnel-origins.toml and the application in
// infra/cluster/dns/access.toml — but the jobs API serves only
// /api/estate/nodes|observations|comparisons (boss-jobs http/mod.rs),
// so no read reaches either file. A fact that lives twice gets an
// equality test (CLAUDE.md §9a): the Rust test
// the_dev_door_is_an_access_ssh_application.rs holds the literal below
// to the route the connector serves, so a drift is a red test rather
// than a terminal block that opens nothing. When the estate reader
