// THE ROUTES THE SERVER SERVES — `GET /api/yard/routes` (design e765b3fc
// §2b, car R2; drawn by car R3 on feedback 84cba7e2).
//
// WHY THE MAP READS THIS AND NOTHING ELSE FOR ITS EDGES. Every section on
// the transit map used to come from a hand-written list in transit.ts
// (PATHS), itself one of three copies of the same ten pairs (world.ts
// BORDERS, boss_jobs::borders::BORDERS), pinned equal to each other and
// to nothing else. The design measured it against the record: of ten
// drawn edges five matched a source, three were partly wrong, two carried
// no packet — and ten real routes were drawn nowhere, among them the one
// David named: "like how the dock routes a train over to the gates before
// it departs onto the tracks." The server now derives every route from
// the protocols (each workflow's ready_when walked through the one
// placement function), the declared hand-offs, and the moves record, and
// serves each with its sources. The page draws exactly that set: a route
// the server stops serving leaves the map, and one it starts serving
// arrives, with no web change. The lint
// `infra/lint/a-map-edge-is-served-not-drawn.sh` refuses a station-pair
// literal under apps/web/src/it/yard/ so a hand-drawn edge cannot return.
//
// AN END IS A REGION OR OFF THE MAP (`null`). A route from nowhere is an
// ENTRY — a packet admitted onto the map — and a route to nowhere is an
// EXIT, an off-ramp: the terminal the packet closed on (David,
// added_2026_09_25_david_offramps: "every packet that leaves the map must
// leave by a drawn route"). `declared: false` is a route only the moves
// record supports — observed, undeclared — drawn dashed red.
//
// Pure functions of the payload, so `bun test` pins every rule without a
// DOM.
