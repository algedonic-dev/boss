// THE MACHINERY IN A TERRITORY (design d2154293, car 5; David's
// feedback c3105b2a, 2026-09-19: zoom into a region to see "moving cars
// and running machinery"). Car 3 gave a territory its moving cars —
// the wagons standing at the stations it covers. This gives it the
// machines that move them: the gate bays, the conductor, the stations,
// the runners.
//
// NOTHING HERE JUDGES A MACHINE. The server does (`boss_jobs::regions`,
// a `machines` list per region), because a machine's state has to mean
// the same thing to the map, the floor and the CLI — the one-definition
// rule that made `/api/yard/regions` the only reading of a region in
// the first place. This module SELECTS, ORDERS and PLACES, and turns a
// state into the class the glyph wears.
//
// A GLYPH MUST READ WITHOUT A LEGEND (Factorio's bar: state legible at
// a glance, without reading labels — a glyph that needs a legend is a
// label with extra steps). Four states, four different things the eye
// does with them:
//
//   running  — the glyph MOVES. A piston sweeps inside the housing.
//              Motion is the one channel nothing else on this map uses,
//              and it is what "running" means everywhere machines are
//              drawn.
//   idle     — still, and SOLID. Housing drawn, nothing inside it.
//   failed   — red and BLINKING, the yard's own alarm idiom (the `err`
//              lamp already blinks on this map).
//   unknown  — the housing is DASHED and carries a `?`. A broken
//              outline reads as "not a reading" before any colour is
//              considered, and the question mark says which reading is
//              missing without a key.
//
// Idle and unknown are the pair this design exists to keep apart. A
// machine nobody can measure drawn as a calm idle box is the
// false-empty class at its most visible, so idle is solid and quiet
// while unknown is broken and marked — different SHAPE, not a different
// shade of the same shape, because shade alone fails at world scale.
