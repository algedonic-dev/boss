// THE LINES THE LIVE MOTION RIDES — the one place the motion (car M2 of
// design e765b3fc, live-motion.ts) is wired to the map's geometry: the
// routes GET /api/yard/routes serves, laid out by route-layout.ts (car
// R3) exactly as RouteLayer.svelte draws them. So a dot travels the
// stroke on the screen — section, exit or entry — lanes and arcs
// included, and walks it by the layout's own `walked`. A move on a route
// the read does not serve answers null here, and live-motion.ts draws it
// dashed red. With the routes unread, nothing is served: every move is
// drawn that way, which is true of what the page knows.
