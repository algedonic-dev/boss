// THE HUD FRAME — whole-system figures, fixed, one row per third
// (design 00774ca8, approved by David 2026-09-24; car F of design
// 62de32ae). The map answers about the PARTS; this answers about the
// WHOLE (design 17567423): per third of the operator surface, is work
// arriving faster than it leaves, and is anything past its bound; and,
// beside the rows, is any machine failed.
//
// NOTHING HERE ADDS ANYTHING UP. Every figure is a field of the one
// `/api/yard/regions` payload that `boss orient` also prints — the
// server's `thirds` block (balance, net included, and the stuck reading)
// and its `machines` cell. The one aggregate that used to stand on the
// world view, `borders.ts::summaryLine`, summed border rows on the
// client and double-counted about 260 backlog items; it is retired with
// this frame (decision 10). The row order and each row's membership come
// from the payload too — this file names no third.
//
// UNKNOWN AND ZERO LOOK DIFFERENT (decision 5, the bar 17567423 set as
// the one that cannot be negotiated). A figure is one of four pictures:
//
//   value   a measured number, plain — or on the troubled plate where
//           the design says so (a stuck count above zero, a failed
//           machine)
//   zero    a true zero: `0`, with no mark at all
//   floor   `≥ n` followed by `?` in its own band — the server counted n
//           and says some of it could not be counted
//   unread  `?` in a dashed housing, never 0 and never blank — the input
//           could not be read
//
// and when the whole read fails every cell turns `unread` and the header
// says "read failed HH:MMZ · last good HH:MMZ". The last good VALUES are
// not kept on screen: a stale figure shown as current is an answer where
// there should have been an error. Only the rows' names survive, so the
// frame keeps its shape.
//
// THE ONE STATED EXCEPTION (decision 4): the delivery row — the row whose
// regions include `arrivals` — shows arrivals per day against the window
// before, read from the SAME field the arrivals territory reads
// (`arrivals.trend`). One field rendered twice cannot drift.
