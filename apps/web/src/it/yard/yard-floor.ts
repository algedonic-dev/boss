// The yard floor — every change as a wagon you can follow.
//
// David approved the rail-map redesign of the Train Yard (2026-09-08)
// with two ideas, both required: a car is a persistent token that
// keeps its identity through every station and SLIDES when its state
// changes, and the page looks like a rail yard — approach siding, gate
// sheds up a branch line, the dock and garage sidings, one mainline
// with semaphore signals, an arrivals yard. This module is the PURE
// half: from the two read models the page already polls (the server's
// `YardStatus` and the client board's `YardState`) it derives a `Scene`
// — where every wagon stands, which bay is busy, how far along the
// line each locomotive is, the order the departure board reads, and
// what each machine's label says. The Svelte map only draws it.
//
// Identity is the whole point. A wagon's id is the car's packet id
// wherever the page can name the car behind a branch (`YardState.cars`
// carries every open car), so the same keyed node moves from the gate
// bay to the dock to the train; only a branch with no car falls back
// to the gate-run or publish-request packet that names it. One branch,
// one wagon: a parked car whose re-gate is running stands in the bay,
// not on the dock and in the bay at once.
//
// Nothing here is invented. Every status line is a fact one of the two
// read models already states; the one number without a server reading
// (how long a gate usually takes) is a named constant, not a policy
// this page pretends to know.
