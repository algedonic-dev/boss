// THE SELECTION'S PANEL — design e765b3fc, car N2. What a station or a
// section says below the map: its rate, what waits and on whom, what is
// stuck, its trend, the band and the why that decided its state, its
// machines and its crossings. Every word is the server's reading turned
// into a sentence; nothing here counts or judges anything of its own,
// and a reading that was not taken is "no reading", never zero.
