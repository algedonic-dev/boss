// THE IT MAP AS A TRANSIT MONITOR — the layout and the words (design
// 16091dfb, answered by David 2026-09-25; backlog ced4ca8b). David,
// 2026-09-24: "I would actually love if our visuals more generally felt
// like a transit monitoring map. I think that is a good way to think
// about the network."
//
// NOTHING HERE DERIVES A JUDGEMENT. Every number is read from the
// server: a section is held because the server's `flowing` is false, a
// station is troubled because the server's state says so, an alarm
// carries the server's own `why`. What this owns is the drawing grammar
// — stations on schematic lines at fixed angles, sections of track
// between them in one colour per line, the waiting packets as blocks on
// the approach, a moving block at the section's real crossing rate, the
// headway a dispatcher reads, and an alarms board in place of a verdict
// written inside a territory.
//
// THE EDGES ARE SERVED, NOT DRAWN (design e765b3fc, car R3 on feedback
// 84cba7e2). Until this car the sections were a hand-written list here
// (PATHS: ten pairs, each with a hand-drawn SVG path), one of three
// copies pinned equal to each other and to nothing else — and it drew
// the train straight from the dock to the track, skipping the gates its
// train gate runs in, the one route David named. The sections are now
// exactly the routes `GET /api/yard/routes` serves (routes.ts), laid out
// by route-layout.ts — a small octilinear router between the two
// stations' positions, each exit an off-ramp — and drawn by
// RouteLayer.svelte. The planned tenant
// branch (design fd8b5143) went with PATHS: no route serves it, and
// nothing is drawn that the record cannot source.
//
// WHAT STAYS DATA HERE is the STATIONS: a layout is not a route. A
// station's position is where the map stands it; which stations a line
// joins is the server's answer. Pure functions of the reading, so `bun
// test` pins every rule without a DOM; TransitMap.svelte owns the strokes
// and the motion.
