  // THE DEPARTMENT MAP — the /it landing (design e765b3fc; David,
  // 2026-09-25: "the operating map sits at the top always and clicking
  // stations or lines pulls up detail below"). The map on top — the
  // transit map under its flight, the world map without it, the strip on
  // a phone — and, below it, the panel of whatever `/it?at=<name>`
  // selects (regions.ts `regionHref`): a station or a section of track.
  // A selection is a query on this one route, so the map is mounted once
  // and a click never tears it down.
  //
  // THE MAP IS PINNED (car N3). "Pinned at the top, always visible": the
  // map holds under the perspective bar while the panel scrolls beneath
  // it, so the thing selected and the detail it opened are on the screen
  // together. Where a pinned map would leave the panel no room — a
  // phone, or a window too short (PIN_QUERY) — it scrolls with the page
  // instead, and the panel is brought into view on a selection either
  // way.
  //
  // WHAT A PAGE WAS IS A PANEL NOW (car N3). A region's floor was its own
  // page at /it/yard/<region>, with a second map of its own (design
  // d2154293 car 3, fe77a1d2, 62de32ae decision 7); car N2 drew the
  // floor's cards in the station's panel, and car N3 retired the page,
  // its map and its route. The Crew Board is the shop floor's panel, and
  // four more pages MOVED here before they retired (panel.ts
  // `STATION_BOARDS` is the table): yard status is the track's, dock's
  // and garage's, the conductor's feed the track's, and the feedback and
  // backlog boards receiving's (the backlog marshalling's too). No alias
  // and no redirect: each old path is not found, and its one door is
  // this map.
  //
  // NO NEW STYLING (the visual redesign reskins): the map is drawn in the
  // yard's own strokes and tokens.
  //
  // Every number is read from ONE endpoint, /api/yard/regions (the rails
  // from /api/yard/borders), on the yard's 10s tick, through fetchRemote
  // — so an outage renders a failure line (`load-failed`), never an empty
  // map that reads as a calm one.
