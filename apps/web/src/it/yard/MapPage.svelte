  // THE IT WORLD — the /it landing. Since design d2154293 (decided by
  // David 2026-09-19; this is car 1) it is ONE SVG world: world.ts lays
  // the regions out as territories along the packet flow and
  // WorldMap.svelte draws them, each with its count, state and trend
  // inside its outline and the why on a troubled one. The 4x2 card
  // grid that stood here (0524fc95 car 2) had no shared coordinate
  // space, no adjacency and no flow — "a world map in a video game
  // where the physical layout and connections make sense" (feedback
  // c3105b2a) is the ask, and the world is becoming THE IT surface
  // (Q2): the floors zoom in on car 3, receiving and marshalling grow
  // interiors on car 4.
  //
  // Every number is read from ONE endpoint, /api/yard/regions, and the
  // page derives nothing — it used to be the other way: yard.ts read
  // six endpoints and derived every number the Train Yard showed, boss
  // orient derived the same numbers again, and nothing held the two
  // equal.
  //
  // CLICKING SWAPS THE VIEW (David, 2026-09-20; backlog ca37478f).
  // /it/yard/<region> is this same page with `region` set, and it
  // renders the REGION's map in place of the world's — not the world
  // drawn nearer. Car 3 read "zoom into the region by clicking to see"
  // (feedback c3105b2a) as a camera walking the viewBox into a
  // territory's rect; David's correction: "I just wanted the world map
  // view to get replaced with the more detailed region map view on
  // click but not literally increase the size of content on the world
  // map." The route was already right — only what it drew was wrong,
  // and the camera is gone. The floor's
  // panels — the alerts, the departure board, the entity deck and its
  // verbs, production and signals — mount UNDER the region map as
  // FloorDeck. The region map is fed by the scene FloorDeck ALREADY
  // reads, handed up through `onfloor`: one read of the floor on the
  // page, not two — the same rule that made the regions endpoint the
  // only reading of a region.
  //
  // ONE MAP PER FLOOR (design fe77a1d2). Car 2: the region map draws
  // its region's slice of the floor and the deck draws no map at all,
  // so the selection that drives the entity panel crosses between the
  // two: the deck hands up what is selected and the function that
  // selects (`onselection`), and a click on the region map goes
  // through that function — one selection, whichever surface took it.
  // Car 3: the deck was still the Train Yard page (YardPage), mounted
  // with its header switched off — a page in name only, with this as
  // its one mount site — so it became the FloorDeck component and the
  // page was deleted. Every route is unchanged.
  //
  // A REGION OWNS ITS PAGE (design 62de32ae, decision 7). The view
  // swapped and the page around it did not: the heading still read "The
  // IT world" inside every region, and the world's summary line sat
  // between the region map and its floor (review 2026-09-24, finding
  // 8). On a region the heading is the region's — "IT · Dock", under a
  // breadcrumb back to the world — and the summary line gives way to
  // the region's own rails in and out (region-page.ts), from the same
  // borders read. The deck scopes its board and alerts the same way.
  //
  // NO NEW STYLING (the visual redesign reskins): the world is drawn in
  // the yard's own strokes and tokens.
  //
  // Polling stays as the yard's: a 10s tick. Reads go through
  // fetchRemote, so an outage renders a failure line (`load-failed`),
  // never an empty map that reads as a calm one.
