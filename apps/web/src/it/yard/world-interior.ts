// RECEIVING AND MARSHALLING GET INTERIORS (design d2154293, car 4).
//
// Car 3 zoomed the camera into a territory and drew what is MOVING
// inside it — the wagons the floor's Scene stands at that region's
// stations. These two regions hold no rolling stock in transit: they
// hold QUEUES. So their interior is a PLATFORM PER QUEUE — a station
// for marshalling, a channel for receiving — with the packets standing
// on it as marks, the queue's bound drawn on the track, and the
// packets past that bound flagged. Until this car both said "this
// region's floor is a page of its own", which was an apology printed
// where the region's own activity belongs.
//
// ONE DEFINITION PER NUMBER. Nothing here reads an endpoint and
// nothing here derives a count: the marshalling platforms are built
// from the sidings `marshalling.ts` already joined (depth from
// `/api/stations/load`, rate from `/api/stations/flow`), the receiving
// platforms from the inbound rows `receiving.ts` already parsed and
// classified. The pages that own those reads hand them up, the way
// YardPage hands its Scene up for the other six territories — one read
// of a region on the page, never two.
//
// A NUMBER NOBODY COULD TAKE IS UNKNOWN, NEVER NOUGHT. A station whose
// flow the cube is blind to (the dock's Job-metadata clause, a
// per-actor watchlist) carries `rate: null`, and the map draws a `?`
// in its own band — on a queue board a 0 reads as "nothing is being
// worked", which is a different fact and usually a false one. The same
// holds for `standing`: null draws no marks at all, where a real zero
// draws an empty track.
//
// Everything here is pure arithmetic over the layout in world.ts, so a
// platform that lies fails world-interior.test.ts before it is a
// picture. WorldMap.svelte owns the strokes.
