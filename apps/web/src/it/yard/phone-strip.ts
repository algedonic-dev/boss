// THE PHONE STRIP MAP (design 62de32ae decision 12, approved by David
// 2026-09-24; car G). On a phone the IT world is not the SVG shrunk
// until its type is unreadable: it is a vertical strip, one row per
// region in flow order, grouped under the three thirds, each row the
// region's state, its KPI and the rail coming INTO it — what waits there
// and how fast it crosses. The review of 2026-09-24 rendered /it at
// 390px and found no phone view at all: a 1240-unit world with a 900px
// floor inside a desktop shell, 1246px wide.
//
// NOTHING HERE DERIVES A NUMBER. The state, the KPI and the rail's
// waiting and rate are the server's (regions.ts, borders.ts), in their
// own words; this module only decides which row each goes on.
//
// THE THIRDS ARE THE SERVER'S. Car F of the same design (design
// 00774ca8, the HUD frame; landed in train #632) made `boss_jobs::
// regions::THIRDS` a partition — every region in exactly one third,
// pinned by `every_region_stands_in_exactly_one_third` — and ships it on
// the regions read as `thirds`, each third's regions in flow order. The
// strip groups by that block and holds no copy of the partition: this
// car's first draft stood one in until F landed, and the copy went the
// day it could.
//
// NOTHING IS DROPPED. A region no third names — or every region, on a
// server older than the block — gets a row under its own heading, in the
// layout's order; a region a third names that the payload did not carry
// gets a row reading "no reading". The map's rule that unknown is drawn
// as unknown, applied to membership.
