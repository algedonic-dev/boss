// THE WORLD MAP'S RAILS — the client of `GET /api/yard/borders`
// (design d2154293, decided 2026-09-19; this is car 2). Car 1 drew the
// regions as territories with a rail between each pair, and the
// rails carried nothing: "I want to see the interactivity between
// regions at the border" (feedback c3105b2a). A border in this system
// is a real thing — packets cross it at a rate, packets stand at it
// waiting, and some machine moves them — and this module is the client
// half of the read that answers all three.
//
// NOTHING HERE DERIVES A JUDGEMENT. The rate, the queue, each hold's
// reason, the machine's silence and the border's clear/attention/troubled
// state are all the server's (boss_jobs::borders); this module parses
// them ONCE and turns them into words. The only thing it decides is how
// to DRAW a rail — how wide (`railWidth`) and at what pace its traffic
// runs (`densityOf`) — which is presentation: the number itself is
// always printed beside it.
//
// AND THE RULE UNDER ALL OF IT: a border whose flow the server could
// not compute renders as UNKNOWN, never as zero. `waiting: null` prints
// "no reading", an unmeasured rate prints "no reading", and an
// unmeasured rate gets its own density band so it cannot be mistaken
// for an empty rail.
