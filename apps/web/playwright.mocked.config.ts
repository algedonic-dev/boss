// Mocked-backend Playwright config — the CI-gated frontend smoke layer.
//
// Unlike playwright.config.ts (which runs the suite against the live
// backend via the dev-server proxy + seeds a scratch stack in
// globalSetup), this config runs specs that intercept EVERY `/api/**`
// call in-browser. So it needs only the dev-server serving the SPA
// shell — no backend, no seeding — which makes it fast, deterministic,
// and safe to gate in the fast `web` CI job. See tests/mocked/_mockApi.ts.

  // No globalSetup — these specs mock the backend, so there is nothing
  // to seed.
  //
  // THE MASS-FAIL SIGNATURE, AND HOW TO TELL THE TWO CAUSES APART.
  // Three times in the week of 2026-08-17 this suite reported 60-70
  // failures in about 20 seconds — every spec dead on connect. That
  // number reads like the app collapsed; it never is. Nothing was
  // serving 127.0.0.1:5174, and there are exactly two ways for that to
  // happen here:
  //
  //   1. THE BOOT RAN OUT OF TIME. Playwright aborts the whole run with
  //      "Timed out waiting 60000ms from config.webServer" and no spec
  //      gets to fail — so if you see that line, this is your cause.
  //      The wait is not a health ping: `bun src/dev-server.ts` bundles
  //      136 .svelte components and 114 .ts modules through
  //      bun-plugin-svelte before / answers 200 at all. Measured on an
  //      M-series laptop, first boot in a fresh checkout: 5.1-6.0s from
  //      process start to that first 200, nearly all of it the bundle
  //      (the server's own line reads `Bundled page in 5966ms`). A
  //      shared, throttled CI container starting from a cold page cache
  //      is a large multiple of that, and 60s was only ~10x the laptop
  //      figure — close enough to lose the race under load. 180s is
  //      ~30x it. The asymmetry is why it is set high rather than
  //      tuned: a too-generous timeout costs wall-clock only in a run
  //      that is already failing, while a too-tight one costs a whole
  //      suite of false red that reads as an app regression.
  //
  //   2. NOTHING WAS EVER STARTED. If instead the specs DO run and each
  //      fails fast on connect, the webServer block was skipped or its
  //      process exited immediately — check PWTEST_SKIP_DEVSERVER in
  //      the environment first (it is honoured just below, and a stale
  //      export from a debugging session survives in a tmux shell), and
  //      read the [WebServer] lines for a port already in use.
  //
  // stdout is piped for that reason: the default swallows the dev
  // server's output, so a boot that fails or crawls leaves no evidence
  // and the only visible artefact is the pile of dead specs. Piped, the
  // run carries its own measurement —
  //
  //   [WebServer] Bundled page in 5966ms: index.html
  //
  // — which is the number to compare when a container looks slow, and
  // the line that is missing entirely when cause 2 is what happened.
