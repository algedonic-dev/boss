// THE OUTAGE CRAWL — backlog 89011641.
//
// route-smoke.mocked.spec.ts asks every surface "do you survive?". This
// spec asks the question that was actually going wrong: "what do you SAY
// when your read fails?"
//
// THE CLASS. A failed read rendered as an empty result. It has now been
// found four times by hand and fixed four times by hand: TriageBoard
// printed already-routed cards under "Nobody has routed these yet" when
// /api/workflows was down; the Inbox announced "Nothing is waiting on
// you" during a message-store outage; HrPage said an employee had no
// onboarding tasks when the step read 503'd; and before those, the two
// instances Remote<T> was introduced for. Every one of them rendered
// perfectly. /ux/hr passed the route crawl for as long as its workflow
// table was structurally incapable of showing a row.
//
// WHY THE EXISTING CRAWL STRUCTURALLY CANNOT CATCH IT. It gates on
// `pageerror` and a shell that never paints. A page that renders a
// falsehood does neither. And a mocked unit test cannot catch it either:
// it asserts what the client does with a fixture the test author wrote,
// so it agrees with a wrong reader by construction.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES. Installs the same adversarial mocks, then forces every
// /api/** call to 500 EXCEPT the handful the app shell needs to paint at
// all (identity + taxonomy — see HEALTHY). Then for each route: the page
// must show at least one FAILURE_MARKER. An outage is the one condition
// where a data-bearing surface has nothing true to say, so saying
// nothing is the bug.
//
// THE NUMBER THIS STARTED FROM (measured 2026-09-11, twice, identical):
// of the 51 crawled routes, 17 showed SOME failure marker and 34 did not. None
// failed to paint, and none of the 34 was silent for want of a broken
// read — every route issues at least three failing requests. So the 34
// are debt, they are listed in SILENT below with what each reads, and
// the list is the work. It is pinned in BOTH directions (see the two
// tests at the bottom) so it can only shrink.

/// identity and the nav cannot resolve visibility without the taxonomy
/// registries, and a crawl where nothing renders measures nothing.
/// Every other endpoint — including the chrome's own /api/jobs/live and
/// /api/jobs/step-types — is broken, which is what makes the assertion
