// Lived under tests/smoke until 2026-09-18, beside the live-backend
// suite that directory held — 35 specs no CI job, gate check or chore
// ran since 2026-06-18, deleted with design 0e07ce64 (the nightly
// playground crawl under tests/live is what replaced them). This
// helper was the one file that stayed, because twelve mocked specs
// imported `mountPage` from `../smoke/_helpers`; it moved here with
// them (backlog ac3270c7), and tests/smoke is gone —
// crates/core/boss-testing/tests/the_playground_is_crawled_nightly.rs
// pins that it stays gone.
//
// The four helpers only the deleted specs used (pinPersona,
// clickButton, clickAndExpectNavigation, expectTableRow) went with them.

/**
 * Wait until `expected` reads have ARRIVED, then give a loop the
 * settling window to show itself, then take the exact count.
 *
 * A window that starts at mount bounds two things at once: how long a
 * loop gets to climb, and how long the FIRST read may take to reach
 * the route handler. Only the first is a spec's claim. On a loaded gate
 * runner the second lost — Expected 1, Received 0 on a correct page, in
 * mount-refetch-audit (backlog 28a60028, 2026-09-20) and then in
 * jobs-kinds-failed-read, which carried the same fixed-wait shape
 * (backlog 3571be7f). A count BELOW the claim is a late read, not a
 * fixed page, and asserting a bound instead (at most one) would pass a
 * page that stopped reading at all — so the count stays exact and the
 * wait is for the condition, under the suite's stated expect budget
 * (playwright.mocked.config.ts), before the window opens. One
 * definition, so the next spec that counts reads takes this rather
 * than a copy of the old shape.
