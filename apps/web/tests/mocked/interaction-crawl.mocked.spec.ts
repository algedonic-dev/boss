// THE INTERACTION CRAWL — backlog f2b8a01c, decided on design 0e07ce64.
//
// route-smoke asks every surface "do you survive?"; outage-crawl asks
// "what do you SAY when your read fails?". This spec asks what a page
// audit asks by hand: does every control on the page DO something, and
// is what it does true? For EVERY crawled route (ROUTES, pinned to the
// catalog by route-smoke's drift test; DEFERRED is shared with it):
//
//   (a) every in-app a[href] is a path the router serves — an href
//       nothing serves is a red naming the page and the link;
//   (b) every button / [role=button] that is not destructive by label
//       (DESTRUCTIVE below) is clicked, and the page must not throw
//       and must answer observably — a navigation to a served route,
//       a dialog, an alert/status line, a request it issued, or a
//       change in what is painted;
//   (c) after each navigation a click caused, history.back() returns
//       to the route the click was made on;
//   (d) the empty-backend leg: with every read answering `[]` (the
//       shell's endpoints and the object-shaped fixtures kept, as
//       outage-crawl keeps them), the page paints an honest empty
//       state — no crash and no FAILURE_MARKER, because nothing failed;
//   (e) the refused-write leg: the same click sequence with every
//       write answered 403 and destructive controls included; a click
//       that issued a write must leave the refusal visible on the page
//       — step-write-failures.mocked.spec.ts, generalised.
//
// Findings name route + control + what happened. A finding on main
// today is a real gap: it is either fixed in the page or listed in
// KNOWN_GAPS with its text, and KNOWN_GAPS is pinned in BOTH
// directions the way outage-crawl's SILENT is — a gap that closes must
// have its line deleted, so the list can only shrink.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-18 on main at #452: 55 routes, 244 links, 145
// distinct page controls + 6 chrome controls clicked on the main leg
// and 151 on the refused leg (7 of them issuing a write), ~220 s of
// browser time for all three legs on one worker. So the catalog is
// split into SHARDS tests that Playwright runs in parallel workers,
// each carrying all three legs for its routes: the total is the same,
// the wall time is ~65 s. The first run found 10 gaps (listed in the
// commit that landed this file); three were fixed with it and the
// rest are KNOWN_GAPS below.
//
// Run: bunx playwright test -c playwright.mocked.config.ts tests/mocked/interaction-crawl.mocked.spec.ts
//   CRAWL_ROUTES=/ux/inbox,/it   crawl only these routes
//   CRAWL_VERBOSE=1              print every click's outcome
