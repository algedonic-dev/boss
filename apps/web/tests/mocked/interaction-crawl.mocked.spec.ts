// THE INTERACTION CRAWL — backlog f2b8a01c, decided on design 0e07ce64.
//
// route-smoke asks every surface "do you survive?"; outage-crawl asks
// "what do you SAY when your read fails?". This spec asks what a page
// audit asks by hand: does every control on the page DO something, and
// is what it does true? For EVERY crawled route (ROUTES, pinned to the
// catalog by route-smoke's drift test; DEFERRED is shared with it):
//
//   (a) every in-app a[href] is a path the router serves — an href
//       nothing serves is a red naming the page and the link;
//   (b) every button / [role=button] that is not destructive by label
//       (DESTRUCTIVE below) is clicked, and the page must not throw
//       and must answer observably — a navigation to a served route,
//       a dialog, an alert/status line, a request it issued, or a
//       change in what is painted (THE JUDGING RULE below);
//   (c) after each navigation a click caused, history.back() returns
//       to the route the click was made on;
//   (d) the empty-backend leg: with every read answering `[]` (the
//       shell's endpoints and the object-shaped fixtures kept, as
//       outage-crawl keeps them), the page paints an honest empty
//       state — no crash and no FAILURE_MARKER, because nothing failed;
//   (e) the refused-write leg: the same click sequence with every
//       write answered 403 and destructive controls included; a click
//       that issued a write must leave the refusal visible on the page
//       — step-write-failures.mocked.spec.ts, generalised.
//
// WHAT (a) CANNOT SEE — backlog d063c290. Leg (a) judges the hrefs the
// mocked backend RENDERS, on the routes in ROUTES (minus DEFERRED), and
// "served" means only that the router does not fall through to its
// catch-all. So three kinds of dead link pass it green:
//
//   - a link nobody generated: a kind whose data is absent under mocks
//     draws no row, so its href is never on any page (ticket and
//     opportunity had no record anywhere in the tree);
//   - a link on a page the crawl does not open: detail pages beyond
//     the two ROUTES seeds, and every DEFERRED route;
//   - a link a greedy wildcard eats: an agreement href parsed as the
//     ACCOUNT page with accountId 'agreements/<id>' — "served", by the
//     wrong page. (Closed for single-id paths by design ee3a3a2f: the
//     wildcards take one segment, so that href is notFound now.)
//
// All three shapes were live at once, on four entity kinds, and this
// crawl stayed green through every one of them until 38d4e458 retired
// them. What covers them is the static pin
// apps/web/src/entity-href-routes.test.ts: for EVERY kind in
// ENTITY_KINDS it asserts parseRoute(entityHref(kind, id)) is the route
// that kind belongs to — no data, no page, no crawl needed. A green here
// means every RENDERED link lands; a link generator the crawl never
// sees rendered is that pin's job. The pin also holds this paragraph's
// pointer and the title below to their claims, so neither can drift.
//
// THE JUDGING RULE — backlog 840c5a76. A click is judged ONCE, at a
// moment its own events fix:
//
//   1. just before the click, what is painted is snapshotted and the
//      page's own record of the API requests it opens is marked
//      (recordPageRequests in _helpers.ts: every fetch, XHR, EventSource);
//   2. after it, the crawl waits, under the suite's stated expect
//      budget, for the requests past that mark that are the CLICK'S —
//      each to arrive as a request event, then each to be answered —
//      re-reading the record as it waits, so a request an answer leads
//      to joins the wait when the page opens it;
//   3. a 250 ms race for a navigation (SETTLE_MS), the record read once
//      more for a request opened during it, and the page is read.
//
// It RESPONDED if it navigated, raised a native dialog or a new
// alert/status/dialog, left its form invalid, is the selected control
// (an idempotent click), ISSUED a request, or changed what is painted
// between the snapshot in 1 and the read in 3. A request is the click's
// unless the page's own clock opened it: a timer callback the click did
// not schedule (a mount-time poll, a ticking refresh) is what a no-op
// click would set off too, so it answers for nothing. A timer the click
// DID schedule — a debounce, a deferred reload — is the click's.
// Nothing extends the wait but requests the click owns, so a silent
// control, which owns none, is judged after exactly the 250 ms it
// always was, and its verdict is read once, never again in the hope
// that something changes.
//
// Two ways to get this wrong, each measured. The judge used to wait on
// "every request in flight", heard only through Playwright's request
// event; a starved host delivers that event late, the set was empty when
// the click returned, and "[/it/operate/perf] RESET — no observable
// response" was read with its POST already on the wire (once in ~26
// shard-1 runs at 5x parallel load). And the naive repair — keep
// re-reading until anything responds — lets a page that polls answer for
// a control that does nothing; the old judge already counted any request
// heard in its window, a poll's included. Both are pinned below by
// forcing them: the race (the POST's answer held back and its event
// handed on late) must not read silent, and an inert control on a page
// polling every 40 ms must.
//
// What the rule still cannot tell apart: a page that REPAINTS on its
// own clock inside the 250 ms race credits that paint change to
// whatever was clicked. That window is the one the judge always had —
// the rule adds no time to it — and a paint change has no author the
// way a request has, so it is named here rather than guessed at.
//
// Findings name route + control + what happened. A finding on main
// today is a real gap: it is either fixed in the page or listed in
// KNOWN_GAPS with its text, and KNOWN_GAPS is pinned in BOTH
// directions the way outage-crawl's SILENT is — a gap that closes must
// have its line deleted, so the list can only shrink.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-18 on main at #452: 55 routes, 244 links, 145
// distinct page controls + 6 chrome controls clicked on the main leg
// and 151 on the refused leg (7 of them issuing a write), ~220 s of
// browser time for all three legs on one worker. So the catalog is
// split into SHARDS tests that Playwright runs in parallel workers,
// each carrying all three legs for its routes: the total is the same,
// the wall time is ~65 s. The first run found 10 gaps (listed in the
// commit that landed this file); three were fixed with it and the
// rest are KNOWN_GAPS below.
//
// Run: bunx playwright test -c playwright.mocked.config.ts tests/mocked/interaction-crawl.mocked.spec.ts
//   CRAWL_ROUTES=/ux/inbox,/it   crawl only these routes
//   CRAWL_VERBOSE=1              print every click's outcome

    // answered (bounded), then the settle is the TIMEOUT of a race
    // against a URL change, and a change that wins is followed to a
    // committed, parsed document before anything reads the page.

    // event, then each to be answered — THE JUDGING RULE in the header.

    // answers lead to (the seasonal-release retire POST is issued only
    // once its GET /api/jobs has answered) joins the wait when the page
    // opens it; it is read once more after the navigation race for one
    // opened during it. The wait ran on "every request in flight" until
    // backlog 840c5a76, heard through Playwright's request event, and
    // that set was EMPTY when a starved host had not yet delivered the
    // Reset POST's event: the wait ended at once and the click was judged
    // silent with its write already on the wire.
    //
    // The wait is under the suite's stated expect budget (a poll every
    // 25 ms), and so are the best-effort waits below: each carried
    // 10 000 ms of its own until backlog de205627, a tighter cap than the
    // suite states, and one that gives up quietly — a click still waiting
    // on a starved host was then read as "no observable response" or
    // "back landed on", a finding about the host rather than the page.
    // A document the click replaced (Sign out's /login) is not the one
    // marked, so its record is not this click's (null); then what the
    // crawl heard is the only record there is, as it was before.
