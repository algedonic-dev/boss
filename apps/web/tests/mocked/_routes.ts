// The roster of crawled surfaces, and the ONE marker a surface uses to
// say a read failed. Both are read by two specs, so both live here.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (CLAUDE.md §9a). `ROUTES` used to live inside
// route-smoke.mocked.spec.ts. outage-crawl.mocked.spec.ts needs the same
// roster, and a second copy of it would reproduce — exactly — the defect
// route-smoke's own drift test was written to stop: a crawl that
// silently omits a surface reports success for a page it never loaded.
// A route added to one list and not the other would be crash-checked and
// never outage-checked, and nothing would say so. So the list is
// collapsed to one definition rather than pinned by an equality test.

/// Every top-level surface a ceo persona reaches, from the router's
/// exact-match routes. Pure-action / form-submit routes (/login,
/// /finance/new, /finance/journal-entries/new) are excluded — the crawls
/// assert surfaces RENDER, not that forms submit. Detail routes are
/// included (a Workflow, a marketing asset, an employee) because the mock seeds them,
/// and that is where the omitted-field crashes live — and one per
/// parameterised catalog path (the rule editor), because a pattern is
/// not a URL a crawl can open.
///
/// Pinned against the route catalog by route-smoke.mocked.spec.ts, so a
/// newly registered surface is crawled by default — by BOTH crawls.
