// incident-review.js — the custom Step UX for the incident protocol's
// "Human review of the findings" step.
//
// Two feedback packets said the review step renders the findings
// unusably (one asked for "a custom step UX that presented the
// findings that I needed to sign-off on"). The findings live in two
// places — the Job's semi-structured metadata and the sibling steps'
// field answers — and the generic surface shows neither. This bundle
// renders both as one readable document, then offers the completion
// the step requires.
//
// Rendered rather than reasoned about (same argument as
// design-doc-packet.mocked.spec.ts): the real bundle file is served
// into a mocked page, because nothing else mounts plugin JS in CI.

/// there is nothing to re-poll in an array already collected, so the
/// one check in this file whose whole job is to be loud about a plugin
/// throwing only ever saw a plugin that threw inside the first 1 500 ms
/// — and recorded a throw at 1 600 ms as no throw at all. Measured on
/// this branch with the pin at the bottom of the file: a plugin that
/// throws when its data arrives, with the read held to 1 800 ms, passed
/// the sleep-then-assert guard.
///
/// So wait for what the plugin DOES instead. It paints a placeholder
/// synchronously, fetches the Job once, and repaints the document from
/// the answer; `.sir-head` is in that second paint and nothing else,
/// which makes it the observable end of every path the mount can throw
/// from. Polling it also reads `errs` on every tick, so a plugin that
/// died in mount reports as the throw it was rather than spending the
/// whole visibility budget on a heading that was never going to appear.
///
/// No budget of its own: `expect.poll` inherits the one
/// playwright.mocked.config.ts states for the suite.
///
/// THE HEADING IS THE ANSWERED READ, NOT THE END OF THE WORK (backlog
/// c90faeb1). `.sir-head` proves the Job read was answered — nothing
/// else paints it — but a throw the answer schedules lands a macrotask
/// LATER, and a poll that read the heading in between resolved green:
/// idle that gap is microseconds, on a loaded gate it is not, and train
/// 2026-09-23 07:01 was struck by it. So once the heading is there the
/// guard queues one macrotask of its own in the page and waits for it.
/// Timers of equal delay run in the order they were queued, and anything
/// the answer queued was queued before the heading could be read, so by
/// the time ours runs every such task has run, and each throw's
/// `pageerror` has crossed the protocol ahead of our reply. That is an
/// ORDER, not a duration — it holds at any load, and it adds no budget.
