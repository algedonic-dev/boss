// Job Detail's landing guard (2026-08-21 UX audit, defect c).
//
// The page's fallback fetches race: the 30s poll, post-action
// refetches, and fast A→B navigation can all have answers in flight
// at once, and without a guard the SLOWEST one wins — packet A
// rendering under B's URL. Every question now carries a ticket
// (monotonic seq + the jobId it was asked about) checked before any
// assignment, so a stale answer is dropped instead of landed.
