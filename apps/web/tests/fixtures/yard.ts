// FIXTURES FOR THE YARD'S TWO EDGE READS — test data, not a layout.
//
// Car R3 of design e765b3fc deleted every edge list the web app drew
// from (world.ts BORDERS, transit.ts PATHS): the world map now draws a
// rail per border the server's `/api/yard/borders` answers, and the
// transit map the routes `/api/yard/routes` derives from the protocols.
// The unit tests and the mocked specs still need a server to answer, so
// the answers live here — under tests/, where the lint
// `a-map-edge-is-served-not-drawn` does not look, because a test's
// fixture is the server's answer standing in, not a drawing.
