# Playwright coverage — controls across the SPA

This is the working index for the "every button gets a test"
effort. Goal: every interactive control in the Svelte SPA has a
passing assertion in `tests/smoke/*.spec.ts`. Pages get checked
off (`[x]`) once their spec covers every `<button>`, `onclick`
handler, form submission, and significant input affordance.

**Two layers.**

- **`tests/smoke/*.spec.ts` — live-stack** (this suite). Runs
  against the dev-server proxying to the real backend
  (`playwright.config.ts`, scratch-isolated). High fidelity but
  needs the stack up; **not yet a CI gate** (Phase-2 work) — so
  treat a stale spec here as a real bug, not noise.
- **`tests/mocked/*.spec.ts` — mocked-backend** (CI-gated). Every
  `/api/**` call is intercepted in-browser
  (`tests/mocked/_mockApi.ts`), so it needs only the SPA shell —
  fast, deterministic, and run in the `web` CI job
  (`bun run test:mocked`, `playwright.mocked.config.ts`). This is
  where interactive behavior we want to *maintain* (e.g. the
  JobKind authoring graph/inspector/workflow rail) is guarded
  against regression.

**Conventions.**

- Test file naming: `<area>-<kind>.spec.ts`. One file per page is
  the default; split when a page has separable flows (e.g.
  `jobs-list.spec.ts` + `jobs-create.spec.ts`).
- Use `tests/smoke/_helpers.ts` for shared utilities — persona
  pinning, navigation, expect-toast, response-mocking. Keep
  per-page specs short and prose-light; the helper is where
  reusable behavior lives.
- Selectors prefer `getByRole({ name: /…/i })` over CSS classes
  so refactors don't break tests. Use class selectors only when
  no role/name fits.
- Each spec MUST exercise the buttons that mutate state, not just
  the page that renders. A button with no assertion against its
  effect doesn't count toward coverage.
- The dev server `bun src/dev-server.ts` is the test target.
  `playwright.config.ts` auto-spawns it via the `webServer` block.

**Counts as of the audit (2026-04-28):** 55 page-level surfaces;
~140 `onclick=` handlers; ~100 explicit `<button>` elements; 1
`<form>`. Plus component-internal controls inside pages (step
plugins, modals, table-row links, etc.) — realistic total is
~300 distinct interactive affordances.

## Pages — coverage status

Sorted by area. Each entry: `[ ]` = uncovered, `[~]` = partial,
`[x]` = every control under test. The `controls` count is a
quick scan (`<button` + `onclick=` deduped); spec authors verify
the actual surface.

### Work
- [x] `me/MePage.svelte` (1 control) —
      `tests/smoke/me-calendar.spec.ts` covers shell-topbar
      mount + (when seeded) job-card → detail navigation.
- [x] `jobs/JobsListPage.svelte` (8) —

      Create Ad Hoc Job entry points + the inline form;
      `tests/smoke/jobs-list.spec.ts` covers status filter
      buttons + subtitle rename + row → detail navigation.
- [x] `jobs/JobDetailPage.svelte` (1) — step interactions live in
      child plugin components. `tests/smoke/detail-pages.spec.ts`

      active-state flip.

### Shop
- [~] `shop/ShopHome.svelte` (6) — `tests/smoke/shop.spec.ts`
      covers hero + filter sidebar mount; product-specific
      assertions skip cleanly because catalog/models is empty in
      the current seed.
- [~] `shop/ShopProductPage.svelte` (4) — same spec file covers
      Request-quote → form → Submit-gate → Cancel; skips when no

      `tests/smoke/admin-job-kinds.spec.ts` covers row → detail
      navigation.
- [x] `admin/JobKindNewPage.svelte` (1) — DAG editor.
      `tests/smoke/admin-job-kind-new.spec.ts` covers spec
      inputs (slug / label / category / description) + subject-
      kind checkboxes + Create-draft button + StepDagEditor's
      Add-tier / Add-step / Show-JSON toggles.
- [~] `admin/JobKindDetailPage.svelte` (6) —
      `tests/smoke/admin-job-kinds.spec.ts` covers Publish/Retire
      disabled-state + Fork navigation. Add-tier / add-step
      controls inside the DAG editor flyout still uncovered.
- [~] `admin/PolicyPage.svelte` (2) —
      `tests/smoke/admin-finance-ops-tail.spec.ts` covers the

      `tests/smoke/design-docs.spec.ts` covers Refresh-from-git
      button + hide-completed checkbox toggle + doc-link nav.
- [~] `design/DesignDocPage.svelte` (12) — same spec file
      covers Flush-to-git button (always rendered, disabled when
      pending=0) + h1; the decision-flow buttons (Accept /
      Override / Prev / Next / Batch-accept) skip cleanly because
      no doc has pending decisions in current seed.

### Integrations / Landing
- [~] `it/ItPanel.svelte` (5) — same spec covers all 4 page
      tabs (Providers / Banking / Payroll / Tax). Provider-row
      expand → action buttons (Configure / Test / Sync) skip
      when no providers seeded.
- [x] `landing/LandingPage.svelte` (2) — JobKind picker on the
      unauth `/`. `tests/smoke/landing-shell.spec.ts` covers the
      hero + jobs-in-flight stat render and the kind-picker /
      recent-job button active-state toggles.

---

## Reusable / shared
- [x] `shell/AppShell.svelte` — sidebar nav links + persona
      switcher. `tests/smoke/landing-shell.spec.ts` covers the
      always-visible My Day + Inbox links + sidebar-group link
      navigation; `persona-switcher.spec.ts` covers the dropdown.
- [x] `debug/DebugGear.svelte` — `tests/smoke/debug-gear.spec.ts`
      asserts the role gate hides the gear when the session
      user's role is not `platform-admin` (the dev-server's
      default persona uses a tenant role like `cto`). The
      allowed-user path (sim buttons + log clear) requires a
      platform-admin session and isn't reachable from smoke.

---

## What "covered" means

A spec covers a page when, for every interactive control on that
page, the spec asserts at least one of:

1. **State mutation.** The click triggers a request whose response
   is observed (URL change, DOM change, toast, …).
2. **UI affordance.** The click toggles a visible UI state
   (dropdown opens, tab selects, modal mounts).
3. **Negative assertion.** The button is correctly disabled / hidden
   based on data state (e.g. "Cancel" disabled while submitting).

Read-only navigation links (table-row → detail-page) count once
per page, not once per row — the same handler runs for every row.

---

## Backlog notes

- Step plugins (`/var/lib/boss/step-plugins/*`) render inside
  JobDetailPage; their controls are out of scope for the
  page-level specs and tracked separately if/when they grow.
- Smoke tests run against the live-sim demo. The tenant seed
  populates accounts / messages / content /
  calendar at install, and the sim grows jobs / commerce / inventory
  / shipping live — so list pages fill in as the sim ticks. On a
  freshly-started demo some pages may still be sparse; list-page row
  tests skip on the "no rows" path until the sim has built them up.
- When dev-server reloads break a spec, prefer fixing the spec
  to `await page.waitForTimeout(…)` — use
  `expect.poll` / `expect(...).toBeVisible({ timeout })`.
- The `{#snippet children()}` wrapper around component bodies
  triggers a bun-plugin-svelte double-children bug (the empty
  auto-snippet shadows the explicit one). The codebase was
  swept of these in c2cf17a + the followup strip; new code
  should rely on Svelte 5's implicit children binding instead.
