**BOSS exists to help the people running a business operate it
better — and to make the basic software that running a business
needs reachable for organizations that can't afford a bespoke
enterprise stack.** Beer Open Source Software for System
Modeling, named in tribute to **Stafford Beer**, the British
cybernetician whose work on the Viable System Model and Project
Cybersyn shaped how I thought about modeling organizations while
designing BOSS. Event-sourced, state-machine-shaped, built around
describing real-world organizations directly.

**The thesis: a reasonably-sized business — a brewery, a
device-refurb shop, a dental practice, a 200-tech field-service
operation — can be modeled directly in software, in its own
terms, with a handful of primitives.**

Most businesses don't run on a model of themselves. They run on
a patchwork — a CRM that knows accounts, a ticketing tool that
knows work, an accounting package that knows money, none of which
knows the others. The real shape of the operation — who owns
what, what must happen before what, what state each thing is in —
lives in the seams: in spreadsheets, in people's heads, in
reconciliation nobody has time for. Each tool holds a partial,
approximate shadow of the business, and keeping the shadows in
sync *is* the overhead.

BOSS collapses the patchwork into one model. A **Subject** (an
account, an asset, an employee), a **Job** (a sale, a service
visit, a hiring pipeline), a **Step** (a typed transition gated
by ownership and sign-off), and the **Event** log over all of it
are one fabric — so an account, the job running against it, and
the GL entry that job posted cross-reference in a single record.
Modeling directly, instead of bending the business into generic
tools, buys three things the patchwork can't:

- **Fidelity — the model is the business, not an approximation
  of it.** A Step is a real person signing off; a Job is a real
  unit of work. The audit log records what the company did in the
  company's own vocabulary, not an analytics derivative
  reconstructed afterward. Operators reason about the software
  the way they reason about the operation, because they're the
  same shape.
- **Adaptability — the model bends as the business does, in
  data, not code.** New work types are JobKind rows; new
  categories — roles, account tiers, asset models — are registry
  entries; new step UX is a plugin. Reshaping the model is
  editing data, not forking a codebase — which is what keeps a
  small team able to follow the operation as it changes.
- **Coherence — one model where a generic stack keeps three.**
  Sales, work, assets, people, and the ledger share Subjects and
  one event log, so the cross-system reconciliation that eats
  operational time mostly stops existing.

Underneath, the model is event-sourced and third-party-verifiable
(above) — replay rebuilds every projection from t=0 — so
durability, auditability, and a one-policy-gate security posture
come from the foundation, not from operator discipline. The
executor model is humans plus agents: agents execute Steps inside
the same schema and sign-off rules as humans, never in the
request path.

The codebase is structured to be conducive to rapid customization
with AI coding agents — with a bit of care to preserve the audit-
log + correctness-protocol contracts at the bottom, the rest is
malleable.

## See it locally

Install it locally and open it in a browser: the demo tenant,
Algedonic Ales, **builds itself live**. A fresh install starts
with an empty audit log (schema + reference data only); the
brewery simulator then ticks forward from the demo epoch (~1
sim-day per ~10 wall-seconds) and generates the operation as it
goes — jobs, orders, invoices, ledger entries, projections. So
the SPA is **sparse on first load and fills in as the sim runs**,
and the audit log grows while you click around. The install (see
[Quick start](#quick-start) below — `docker compose up`, ~20-25
min cold) builds from source and seeds the tenant through the
public API; the bootstrap-admin email you set in `.env` becomes
your login.

A few specific places that land the design quickly (all served
by the local install on `:4443`):

| If you want to see … | Open |
|---|---|
| The home dashboard with live system activity | <http://localhost:4443/> |
| A Job from the brewery flow with its step graph | <http://localhost:4443/ux/jobs/> (click any open Job) |
| The full event log streaming as the sim ticks | <http://localhost:4443/system/monitoring/events> |
| The System Atlas — every service + its event topics | <http://localhost:4443/system/monitoring/atlas> |
| The brewery's people, with role-based scoped views | <http://localhost:4443/ux/people> |
| A workflow's anatomy (JobKind authoring surface) | <http://localhost:4443/system/job-kinds> |

Both install paths land on `:4443` (gateway in demo mode +
local-auth). What you see is the head of `main` plus the data
the simulator has generated since you started the stack.

## What's in the box

The workspace splits into four tiers (see CLAUDE.md):

- **Core state-machine OS** — `crates/core/`. The generic primitives every deployment uses:
  Subjects, Jobs, Steps, the audit log + projection rebuilders,
  the JobKind / StepType / StepPlugin registries, policy,
  gateway/auth/NATS, calendar, and the two taxonomy registries.
  Tenant-neutral.
- **Company-modeling layer** — `crates/modules/`. Useful for modeling a company on top of the core:
  people, accounts, commerce, inventory, ledger, products,
  shipping, messages, catalog, assets, plus their `*-client`
  HTTP-contract crates and the `boss-ml-plugins` extension
  surface. A non-company tenant (a research lab, a robot fleet)
  can deploy without these.
- **Orchestrators** — `crates/orchestrators/`. Binaries that fan out across both tiers:
  `boss-rebuild`, `boss-cli`, `boss-sim`, `boss-ml-api`, `boss-simulator`.
- **Tenants** — `crates/tenants/`.
  - **Algedonic Ales** (`boss-brewery-engine`) — the public OSS
    demo tenant. Data-first seeds at `examples/brewery/` (TOML +
    JSON) plus the brewery-specific JobKinds. Industrial-scale
    brewer modeled across 5 beer styles.
  - **Used-device-shop** (`boss-used-device-shop-engine`) — sells,
    services, and resells used physical devices needing
    sophisticated diagnostics + repair. Data lives at
    `examples/used-device-shop/`.

Adding a third tenant takes two TOML files and a JSON seed — no new Rust, no new web code.

The full crate-by-crate map and service topology live in
[docs/architecture-diagram.md](docs/architecture-diagram.md).
Port assignments are the canonical
[`crates/core/boss-ports/src/lib.rs`](crates/core/boss-ports/src/lib.rs).

## Quick start

Two paths — pick whichever matches your environment.

**Docker compose** (fastest, ~10 min cold):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/algedonic-dev/boss.git
cd boss/infra/oss-quickstart
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — set BOSS_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
docker compose up
```

Open `http://localhost:4443`.

**Bare-metal local** (with Postgres 16+, NATS, Rust stable,
Bun 1.1+ installed):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/algedonic-dev/boss.git
cd boss
./infra/oss-quickstart/quickstart.sh
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4443`.

Either way, the bootstrap-admin email you provide becomes the
seed `platform-admin` Employee, the install seeds the brewery
tenant (JobKinds, accounts, vendors, reference data), and the live
brewery sim ticks ~1 sim-day per 86 wall-seconds, building the demo
from there. Full runbook + troubleshooting at
[`infra/oss-quickstart/README.md`](infra/oss-quickstart/README.md).

> **The demo builds itself live.** The install starts the brewery sim
> against an empty `audit_log`, so the SPA is sparse on first load and
> fills in as the sim runs — which keeps the clone small and the install
> fast. Maintainers validate a full sim-year with
> `sudo ./infra/postgres/validate-brewery-sim.sh`: it runs the sim and
> asserts a clean rebuild + conservation/integrity.

> ⚠  **Not production-ready.** The quickstart runs the whole
> platform on one machine with no real authentication. Anyone
> with network access to the host has full operator privileges.
> Adding an integrated IAM (Authelia or any OIDC IDP via
> forward-auth) and a hardened production-infrastructure
> template are queued under "Post-release" in
> [`TODO.md`](TODO.md).

## Production posture

For deployments past the eval stage, v1's recipe is **single VM
with a backup strategy**. One host runs the full stack —
Postgres, NATS, every `boss-*-api`, the gateway, the static SPA.
`infra/backup.sh` ships pg_dump snapshots off-box on a systemd
timer; the `audit_log` is the disaster-recovery primitive (any
snapshot replays cleanly via `boss-rebuild-all`).

The systemd-managed deploy lives at
[`infra/deploy-services.sh`](infra/deploy-services.sh); the
operator runbook is at
[`docs/runbooks/operator.md`](docs/runbooks/operator.md).
Cloud-provider provisioning recipes (Azure, GCP, AWS,
Cloudflare, Hetzner) are queued post-release under
`infra/blueprints/<provider>/` per the TODO entry.

Multi-VM topologies (warm-standby Postgres replication,
active/active data planes, edge load balancers) are deliberately
out of scope for v1 — they get reconsidered when a real tenant's
SLAs force the conversation. The post-release **Production
Infrastructure Template** TODO entry is where that work lands.

## Building & quality

Test discipline matters because the platform claims correctness as
a first-class invariant (see *Founding ideas* above). The full
strategy — what each layer catches, where it runs, what fails the
build vs what triggers an incident — lives at
[docs/design/testing-strategy.md](docs/design/testing-strategy.md).
The summary:

| Layer | Mechanism | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| Static checks | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features --tests -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`, `bun run typecheck` (svelte-check, strict TS) | CI on every push + PR |
| Unit + integration tests | ~1,640 Rust `#[test]` cases across the workspace + Svelte component tests; `cargo test --all-features` | CI + local |
| Lints beyond the type system | `infra/lint/seed-bypass-smell.sh` rejects seed scripts that bypass the JobKind path; `cargo clippy` lint set is the strict superset | CI |
| Audit-log integrity | `boss-audit-integrity-check` verifies the per-row hash chain on `audit_log` and the `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE` schema-level append-only enforcement | systemd timer (daily) in prod |
| Conservation invariants | `infra/lint/conservation-invariants.sh` proves the five-property correctness protocol — provenance, conservation, closure, idempotence, determinism — across every projection vs. the `audit_log` it derives from | systemd timer in prod, on-demand locally |
| Replay rebuild | `boss-rebuild-all` reconstructs every projection from `audit_log` alone and `infra/verify-replay.sh` diffs the result against live state | on-demand; in CI via `validate-brewery-sim.sh` (runs a sim-year, then asserts a clean rebuild) |
| Service + binary drift | `infra/check-service-drift.sh` validates the systemd unit set, `check-service-write-roundtrip.sh` exercises every write endpoint against real Postgres, and `check-binary-build-coverage.sh` catches `*-api` binaries that would silently boot in-memory because their `postgres` feature isn't activated | on-demand + cron |

The "always green" claim isn't aspirational. Audit-log integrity
runs every 24 h; conservation invariants run on a timer; replay
rebuild is a CI step on every push that touches a projection. A
red signal anywhere is an incident, not a flaky test to retry.

```sh
# Workspace build (15–20 min cold, ~30 s warm).
cargo build --release --workspace

# Full test sweep — ~1,640 Rust tests + the bun web suite (~3 min cold).
cargo test --all-features
( cd apps/web && bun run typecheck && bun test )

# Run the in-tree integrity checks against a local Postgres.
infra/lint/conservation-invariants.sh
infra/verify-replay.sh
```

CI configuration: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
The `release.yml` workflow cuts versioned `boss` CLI binaries; the
prod-deploy pipeline (cross-compile + scp + systemctl restart) is
queued — see [TODO.md](TODO.md).

## Founding ideas

Three intellectual lineages sit behind the design: **Stafford
Beer** (cybernetics — companies as viable systems shaped by
feedback loops and *algedonic* signals), **Rich Hickey**
("information is simple" — data is primary, mutation pays
forever, event-sourced + immutable values everywhere), and
**George Orwell** (*Politics and the English Language* —
communication decays when words drift from reality, so the audit
log + the five-property correctness protocol keep the language
operators use anchored to the facts).

All three converge at the same claim from different angles: the
company *is* its event log + its current state + the rules
connecting them. Full elaboration in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#founding-ideas--what-every-load-bearing-decision-is-measured-against).
