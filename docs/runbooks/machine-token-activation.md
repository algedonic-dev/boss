# Machine token activation (7fcd78fa phase 1)

**Status**: living

The code side is done and dormant: the jobs API refuses tokenless
writes ONLY once `BOSS_MACHINE_TOKEN` is set in its environment, and
every in-repo writer attaches the same env var's value when it has
one. Activation is therefore a pure ops action, done by David (token
administration is his by standing rule), and rollback is unsetting
the variable on the jobs API.

## What carries the token already (code, this car)

- jobs API: enforcement on POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE (`machine_gate.rs`);
  GET/HEAD/OPTIONS stay open in phase 1.
- gateway: stamps the token on session-authenticated proxied traffic;
  the edge strip kills any client-supplied copy.
- dispatcher, dispatcher handlers (shared `api_client()`), conductor
  (`boss train`), sim workforce, brewery bootstrap: default header
  when the env var is set.
- every folded `boss-*-client` (via `http_client::base`).
- maintenance shell writers (`boss-step.sh`,
  `boss-maintenance-wrap.sh`): `${BOSS_MACHINE_TOKEN:+-H …}`.

## Activation steps (David)

1. Generate, without echoing into a transcript:
   `openssl rand -hex 32 > /some/offline/place`
2. Cluster: create the secret and add `BOSS_MACHINE_TOKEN` (from that
   secret) to the env of: jobs-api, gateway, dispatcher, brewery
   engine, sim, and the maintenance CronJobs. One secret, one key.
3. boss-gcp: add `BOSS_MACHINE_TOKEN` to the conductor's timer/unit
   environment (systemd drop-in), and write the value to
   `/etc/boss/machine-token` (mode 0600, David-owned) for the wrapper
   patch below.
4. Patch `~/bin/boss-api` (David's file, outside the repo) so agent
   sessions keep working without the token ever reaching the Mac —
   the token is read ON boss-gcp at call time:

   ```
   -CURL="curl -sS -X $METHOD -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Boss-User: $ACTOR' -w '\n%{http_code}' '$BASE$API_PATH'"
   +CURL="TOK=\$(cat /etc/boss/machine-token 2>/dev/null || true); curl -sS -X $METHOD -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Boss-User: $ACTOR' \${TOK:+-H \"X-Boss-Machine-Token: \$TOK\"} -w '\n%{http_code}' '$BASE$API_PATH'"
   ```

5. Restart / roll the deployments. The jobs-api log line
   `machine token configured: writes require x-boss-machine-token`
   confirms the door is armed; the `no BOSS_MACHINE_TOKEN configured`
   warning is the dormant state.

## Verifying, and what a miss looks like

A writer missed by this list fails loudly, not silently: its log
shows `401 … machine door: writes require the x-boss-machine-token
header … this caller sent no token`. That message is the work order —
attach the env var to that process. Reads are untouched, so
dashboards and lenses keep rendering while a missed writer is fixed.

Rollback: unset `BOSS_MACHINE_TOKEN` on the jobs API and restart it.
Everything else may keep the variable; attaching to an open door is
harmless.

## Phase 2 (not this car)

Reads join the gate once every legitimate caller demonstrably carries
the token (watch for 401s at zero for a week). Phase 3, mTLS, only if
the fabric grows callers outside the WireGuard net.
