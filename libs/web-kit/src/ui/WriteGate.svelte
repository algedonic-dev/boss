  // The readonly gate — ONE mechanism for every write surface.
  //
  // `session.readonly` is true for the audit-readonly guest: a
  // first-class visitor who may read every projection and change
  // nothing. Before this gate the flag had a single consumer (MePage)
  // while ~43 files issued writes, so a guest saw live composers,
  // pickers and transition buttons everywhere — each one a 403 waiting
  // for the click. The session said "read-only"; the surfaces said
  // "act". They have to agree.
  //
  // Mechanism: children render inside a <fieldset> that is disabled
  // exactly when the session is readonly. Disabling a fieldset
  // natively disables every descendant form control — button, input,
  // select, textarea — which is precisely the write-surface alphabet,
  // with no per-control edits and no divergence for surfaces added
  // later (StepPlugins mount inside the same gate). A quiet note names
  // why, and names the way back in.
  //
  // Wrap write AFFORDANCES (a step surface, a composer trigger, an
  // action row) — never read chrome like filters or navigation.
